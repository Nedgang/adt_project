in life science research and applications.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
- Big Data Integration for the life sciences
- Ontology mappings and evolution
- Large-scale data analysis for the life sciences
- Architectures and data management techniques for the life sciences
- Query processing and optimization for biological data
- Biological data sharing and update propagation
- Query formulation assistance for scientists
- Modeling of life sciences data
- Biomedical data integration issues in eScience
- Laboratory information management systems in biology (including
workflow systems)
- Quality assurance in integrated biological data repositories
- Biomedical metadata management (including provenance)
- Mining integrated life sciences data and text resources
- Standards for biomedical data integration and annotation
- Scientific results arising from innovative data integration solutions
- Exposing biomedical data for integration (APIs, Linked Open Data,
SPARQL endpoints)
- Creation and use of clinical data repositories
- Data integration in clinical and translational research
- Integration of genotypic and phenotypic data
- Challenges and opportunities with big data in the life sciences
- Ethical, legal and social issues with biomedical data integration.

Papers are to be prepared using LNCS templates and submitted using the
EasyChair site:
https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=dils2014.

The proceedings of DILS will be published by Springer in Lecture Notes
in Bioinformatics.

The authors of the best papers will be invited to submit an extended
version of their DILS paper for publication in a supplement of the
Journal of Biomedical Semantics.


*Posters and Demos*

DILS2014 also invites the submission of posters and demos to be
presented in the poster/demo session at the conference. The poster/demo
abstracts will not be included in the DILS 2014 proceedings, but will be
