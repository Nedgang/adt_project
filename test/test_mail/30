Subject: [bioinfo] Announcement: FMMB 2014

FMMB 2014 - 1st INTL. CONFERENCE ON FORMAL METHODS IN MACRO-BIOLOGY
   Call for Papers
   September 22-24, 2014
   Noumea, New Caledonia
   http://fmmb2014.sciencesconf.org/
* AIMS AND SCOPE
   The purpose of FMMB is to bring together researchers, developers,
   and students in theoretical computer science, applied mathematics,
   mathematical and computational biology, interested in studying the
   application of formal methods to the construction and analysis of
   models describing biological processes at both micro and macro levels.
   The topics of interest include (but are not limited to):
   - representation and analysis of biological systems in formal systems
     such as:
       o ordinary and partial differential equation systems,
       o discrete event systems, infinite state systems,
       o hybrid discrete-continuous systems, hybrid automata,
       o cellular automata, multi-agent systems,
       o stochastic processes, stochastic games,
       o statistical physics models,
       o process algebras, process calculi,
       o rewriting systems, graph grammars,
   - coupling models and data, inference of models from data,
   - computability and complexity issues,
   - modelling and analysis tools, case studies.
   Application areas particularly solicited include:
   - environmental biology, ecology, marine science,
   - agriculture and forestry,
   - developmental biology, population biology,
   - epidemiology, medicine,
   - systems biology, synthetic biology.
