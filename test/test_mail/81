CALL FOR PAPERS ACA 2014

ACA 2014

Third International Workshop on Asynchronous Cellular Automata and
Asynchronous Discrete Models
at 11th International Conference on Cellular Automata for Research
and Industry (ACRI 2014)

Krakow, Poland, September 22-25, 2014

ORGANIZER

AGH University of Science and Technology in Krakow

AIMS and SCOPE

Cellular Automata are a well-known formal tool for modeling complex
systems; they are found in many scientific fields and industrial
applications. Synchronous updating is one of the main features of Cellular
Automata. Indeed, in the most common Cellular Automata framework, all
cells are updated simultaneously at each discrete time step.

Recent trends consider the modeling of asynchronous systems based on local
interactions. The aim of this workshop is to bring together researchers
dealing with the theme of the asyncrony inside Cellular Automata and other
Discrete Models such as discrete Multi-Agents Systems, Boolean Networks,
and so on,in order to foster their interaction and to provide a forum for
presenting new ideas and works in progress on the subject.

Topics include, but are not limited to the following aspects of
Asynchronous Cellular Automata and Asynchronous Discrete Models (such as
Multi-Agents Systems, Boolean Networks and so on):

- dynamics
- complexity issues
- computational issues
- emergent properties
- models of parallelism and distributed systems
- models of phenomena from biology, chemistry, physics, engineering and
other fields

Contributions of both theoretical and applicative interest are welcome.

*SUBMISSIONS AND PUBLICATION*

Authors are invited to submit papers according to two contribution
categories -- full and short papers -- meant  to provide a differentiation
of the papers in terms of their length, depth and/or maturity. Papers must
comply with the Springer-Verlag format and the maximum length of 5 and 10
pages for short and full contributions, respectively.

Details on the electronic submission procedure will be provided through
the website

http://acri2014.agh.edu.pl

Accepted papers will be published by Springer-Verlag in the Lecture Notes
in Computer Science (LNCS) series.

*SPECIAL ISSUE*

Selected papers will be considered for publication in a Special issue of
an international journal (such as NaCo). They will contain refereed
extended/improved versions of selected papers presented at ACA workshop.

IMPORTANT DATES:

Paper submission: April 15, 2014
Notification of paper acceptance or rejection: May 14, 2014
Final version of the paper for the proceedings: June 8, 2014
