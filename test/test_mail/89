Subject: [bioinfo] Post-doctoral position in bioimage and bioinformatics for microRNA therapeutics in heart failure

Job Advertisement: Position at the post-doctoral level for 1 year at the Sy=
stems and Modeling research unit at the GIGA Biomedical Research Center and=
 at the Montefiore Institute of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science=
, at the University of Li=E8ge, Belgium.

Within European FP7 Marie Curie Work Programme coordinated by Prof. dr. S. =
Heymans (Maastricht University), we are looking for an excellent, highly co=
mpetitive researcher at the post-doctoral level.  He/she should have worked=
 for at least 3 years outside Belgium during the past years.

Topic : Development & application of machine learning, image analysis, and =
bioinformatics techniques for high-throughput and high-content  analysis fo=
r microRNA-medicines for Cardiac Metabolic Diseases.

Keywords: Machine Learning =96 Image Analysis =96 Bioimage Informatics - Bi=
oinformatics

Environment: The GIGA Research Center with excellent research groups in bio=
logy, bioinformatics, and machine learning fields grouped together.

Project:  The researcher will be working closely with a team of software de=
velopers, researchers in machine learning & bioinformatics, and biologists,=
 to advance high-throughput automated analysis of bioimaging & microRNA dat=
a. The applicant will be involved in the application of existing algorithms=
 and the design of novel algorithms and their large-scale evaluation for ce=
llular image recognition and phenotype quantification to discover novel mic=
roRNAs implicated in heart failure. She/He will have access to a high-perfo=
rmance computing environment and various bioinformatics tools including the=
 inhouse developed Cytomine platform able to process terabytes of imaging d=
ata.

Capacities & Experiences: Applicants should hold a PhD and have strong know=
ledge in machine learning, bioinformatics and/or computer vision. Programmi=
ng and data analysis skills are also highly desirable. The candidates shoul=
d be highly motivated, with a strong interest in large-scale biomedical app=
lications. A working knowledge of English language is mandatory

This project is a collaborative project (exchange of people) between Maastr=
icht University (Netherlands), Cenix Biosciences (Dresden, Germany) and Sys=
tMod (GIGA, Li=E8ge, Belgium).

Interested candidates should send a CV,  a brief statement of research and =
development interests, three relevant publications, and the names and conta=
ct details of two references by e-mail  (with subject =93Postdoc CardiomiR=
=94) to: raphael.maree@ulg.ac.be; p.geurts@ulg.ac.be
