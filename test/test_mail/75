Subject: [bioinfo] two Post-Doctoral Research Positions in computational structural biology / structural bioinformatics (INRIA Grenoble)

Two post-doctoral research positions are open in the framework of the PEPSI=
 (Polynomial Expansions of Protein Structures and Interactions) ANR project=
 (http://pepsi.gforge.inria.fr) at NANO-D group of INRIA Grenoble (http://n=
ano-d.inrialpes.fr).

The goal of the first position is to develop an exhaustive-search FFT-based=
 method that incorporates a very detailed knowledge-based interaction poten=
tial. This will combine the speed of FFT-accelerated techniques (which are,=
 however, rather inaccurate) with the precision of state-of-the-art scoring=
 functions (which are too slow otherwise). This work will be grounded on th=
e spherical polar Fourier (SPF) correlation FFT docking algorithm developed=
 by our collaborators (Ritchie and Kemp 2000), which operates on potentials=
 expressed in a basis of orthogonal functions. Later, we will express the k=
nowledge-base potential in the Cartesian basis set and utilize a polar/Cart=
esian FFT algorithm.

The second position is for the development of algorithms for annotating and=
 fitting of electron density maps. Medium resolution cryoEM electron densit=
y maps pose a challenge: at sub-nanometer resolution, =CE=B1-helices become=
 resolvable, and as the resolution improves further, =CE=B2-sheets become d=
iscernible, eventually showing strand separation. In this intermediate (~5-=
10 =C3=85) resolution range, tools for automatic identification and localiz=
ation of secondary structure elements become quite valuable. The first task=
 will be to use supervised learning and exhaustive search techniques to aut=
omatically identify regions inside the map that belong to different structu=
ral traits, =CE=B1-helices or =CE=B2-sheets. Grounded on our recently devel=
oped exhaustive=E2=80=93search FFT-based algorithms for fitting a structure=
 into a density map, the second task deals with symmetry information in the=
 formulation of the fitting problem.=20

Desired profile:
We are looking for creative, passionate and hard-working individuals with e=
xceptional talent for computer science and mathematics. Excellent oral, wri=
tten and interpersonal communication skills are essential (working language=
 will be English =E2=80=93 knowledge of French is not necessary, but a plus=
).

Requirements
	Strong computer science background (knowledge of machine learning is a plu=
s)
	Strong knowledge of applied math (linear algebra, signal processing, Fouri=
er analysis, polynomial expansions)
	Strong oral, written and interpersonal communication skills (working langu=
age: English =E2=80=93 knowing French is a plus)
	Good knowledge of C++
	Fair knowledge of parallel computing frameworks (threading libraries and G=
PU)
	Fair knowledge of structural biology
	Ability to work independently and with a team

Benefits
	Possibility of French courses
	Help for housing
	Scientific resident card and help to obtain visa (for both you and your sp=
ouse)

Salary and duration:
2,620.84 =E2=82=AC gross/month for 18 months
Monthly salary after taxes: around 2,138 =E2=82=AC (medical insurance inclu=
ded).

About Grenoble:
Grenoble is the capital city of the French Alps. Combining the urban life-s=
tyle of southern France with a unique mountain setting, it is ideally situa=
ted for outdoor activities. The Grenoble area is today an important centre =
of industry and science (second largest in France). Dedicated to an ambitio=
us policy in the arts, the city is host to numerous cultural institutions. =
With 60,000 students (including 6,000 foreign students), Grenoble is the th=
ird largest student area in France.=20

About the NANO-D research group at INRIA:
The NANO-D group, led by Stephane Redon at INRIA, develops novel multiscale=
, adaptive modeling and simulation methods, which automatically focus compu=
tational resources on the most relevant parts of the nanosystems under stud=
y. All algorithms developed by the group are gathered into SAMSON, an open-=
architecture software platform designed by NANO-D (SAMSON: Software for Ada=
ptive Modeling and Simulation Of Nanosystems).=20
During the twentieth century, the development of macroscopic engineering ha=
s been largely stimulated by progress in numerical design and prototyping: =
cars, planes, boats, and many other manufactured objects are nowadays desig=
ned and tested on computers. Digital prototypes have progressively replaced=
 actual ones, and effective computer-aided engineering tools have helped cu=
t costs and reduce production cycles of these macroscopic systems.
The twenty-first century is most likely to see a similar development at the=
 atomic scale. Indeed, the recent years have seen tremendous progress in na=
notechnology - in particular in the ability to control matter at the atomic=
 scale. Similar to what has happened with macroscopic engineering, powerful=
 and generic computational tools will be employed to engineer complex nanos=
ystems, through modeling and simulation. The NANO-D group is funded through=
 ANR grants, an ARC grant, and an ERC Starting Grant (http://nano-d.inrialp=
es.fr).=20=20
