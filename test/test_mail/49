MCEB - Mathematical and Computational Evolutionary Biology, 15-19 June 
2014 - South of France

Webpage: http://www.lirmm.fr/mceb2014/
Pre-registration deadline: February 15

Scope: Mathematical and computational tools and concepts form an 
essential basis for modern
evolutionary studies. The goal of the MCEB conference (at its 6th 
edition) is
to bring together scientists with diverse backgrounds to present recent 
advances and
discuss open problems in the field of mathematical and computational 
evolutionary
biology. This year a special focus will be given to the applications to 
biodiversity in all
its aspects: from its conservation to its ecology and evolution; from 
the diversity within
a genome, to that between individuals within a species and that between 
species in an ecosystem.
General concepts, models, methods and algorithms will also be presented 
and discussed, just as
during the previous conference editions.

Where and when: Hameau de l'Etoile (http://www.hameaudeletoile.com/) in 
the Montpellier
region, South of France, 15-19 June 2014.

Cost: Conference fees including accommodation (4 nights), meals, coffee 
breaks, buses,
etc., will be around 500 €, and will vary depending on the room type.
PhD students and postdocs will benefit of the cheapest rooms.

Richard Durbin (Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, UK): Population genomics
Nicolas Lartillot (Lab. Biométrie et Biologie Evolutive, FR): 
Comparative genomics and ecology
Arne Mooers (Simon Fraser University, CA): Considering the Tree of Life 
in Conservation
Hélène Morlon (Centre de Mathématiques Appliquées, FR): Dynamics of 
biodiversity
Rasmus Nielsen (University of Berkeley, US): Theory and methods

Adam Siepel (Cornell University, US): Genome-wide inference of ancestral 
recombination graphs
Mike Steel (University of Canterbury, NZ): What can we reconstruct from 
the past?
Simon Tavaré (Univ. of Cambridge and Univ. of Southern California ): 
Cancer as an evolutionary process
