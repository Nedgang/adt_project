Postdoc Bioinformatics: Synthetic Systems Biology

Genome Institute of Singapore (A*STAR)



The Genome Institute of Singapore (GIS) together with the Bioprocessing Technology Institute (BTI) and Duke-NUS launched development of a new sythetic biology platform to engineer cellular phenotypes. The aim of this project is to model gene regulation using large-scale genomics data, and to synthetically reproduce computational predictions in cell lines. The GIS is looking for a bioinformatics postdoctoral fellow with experience in systems biology, genomics, or machine learning to lead the computational analysis.



Requirements

Candidates should have a PhD in a mathematical discipline (or related), a solid understanding of probability, statistics, and machine learning, and experience in one or more of the following areas: transcriptome analysis, regulatory genomics, DNA sequence analysis, motif finding. The candidate should have strong programming skills, excellent academic grades and very good communication skills in written and spoken English.
