Subject: [bioinfo] research internship @ Xerox Research Centre Europe



An open internship position on a mix of string algorithms, grammatical

inference and statistical machine learning





*Description*



We are looking for a motivated intern for a project involving the use

of sequential patterns for the inference of grammars.



The Smallest Grammar Problem is the problem of finding the smallest

context-free grammars that generates exactly one given sequence. We

plan to generalize this in order to find grammars which generate a set

of natural language documents with a strong but hidden structure. This

structure will then be converted into additional features (through

tree kernels for example) in our analytics pipeline or alternatively

as a starting template for existing multilingual authoring tools.



*Requirements*



Research-oriented master student or PhD candidate in computer science

Knowledge of standard text algorithms and data structures

Knowledge of formal grammars (a course covering the Hopcroft & Ullman

book or equivalent for example)

Knowledge in statistical machine learning applied to text is a strong plus

Fluency in either C, C++ or Java is a plus



The intern will work closely with researchers in a very international

environment, and will be strongly encouraged to produce scientific

publications.



*Duration*: 5-6 months

*Start Date*: March-April 2014



*Application instructions*



Informal inquiries are welcome and can be made at

matthias.galle@xrce.xerox.com .



To submit an application, please send your CV and cover letter to both

xrce-candidates@xrce.xerox.com and matthias.galle@xrce.xerox.com .



Ideally, you will also include in your CV people we can contact for

letters of recommendation.
