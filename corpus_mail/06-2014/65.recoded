GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT ADDICTION

*******************************************************



ADDICTION is the second international event organised by the Inria

AMICI International Partnership (http://team.inria.fr/bamboo/amici/).



Its focus is on:

- smart data structures;

- algorithm engineering and experimental algorithms;

- probabilistic algorithms;

- (M)ILP approaches simple and enumerative.

On the application side there will be a special interest in computational


biology. The School is addressed to young researchers at the PhD

student or postdoc level, but may, depending on space, greet other

interested participants. The scope of ADDICTION is international.



COURSES AND LECTURERS

***********************************



The school features the following four lecturers:



* Friedrich Eisenbrandt (EPFL, Switzerland)



* Giuseppe Italiano (University of Rome "Tor Vergata", Italy)



* Kurt Melhorn (Max-Planck-Institute f=FCr Informatik at

Saarbr=FCcken, Germany)



* Eli Upfal (Brown University, USA)



A title for their lectures will be provided soon on the school's

website.



LOCATION

*************



ADDICTION will be held at the Olissippo MarquÃªs de S=E1 hotel,

in Lisbon, Portugal. The hotel is a 2-minutes walk away from the

Calouste Gulbenkian Museum and its beautiful park. It is located

just between two of the main Metro lines of Lisbon.



Situated on the west coast of the country, where the Tagus river

meets the Atlantic Ocean, Lisbon is the western-most capital in

mainland Europe. It is known as the white city, thanks to its unique

luminosity. The light, the atmosphere and the climate offer

marvelous walks all over the city. Lisbon is extremely lively,

with a wealth of cultural events happening every day, and a vibrant

nightlife. A huge selection of restaurants is available, featuring

Portuguese and international cuisine.



Lisbon can be easily reached by daily direct flights from major

international cities.
