Accepted full papers should be presented in the conference and  they will be  published as chapters of the book BIOMAT 2014, a volume of the BIOMAT Annual Series of World Scientific Co. and indexed at ISI-Web of Science - Conference Proceedings Citation Index, MathSciNet, Zentralblatt f√ºr Mathematik, etc.  Each chapter has an exclusive DOI link number.



We will be also pleased to answer all  additional queries you may have as the submission and evaluation processes are concerned.





2.  Financial  Support



The BIOMAT 2014 International Symposium has a special offer of fellowships for authors of abstracts and full papers.  These will consist of Free Lodging and Full  Board at the Bedlewo Conference Centre of the Stefan Banach Mathematical Centre including breakfast, lunch, dinner and two coffee breaks per day.   Fellowships will be attributed on a first come first served basis, but we strongly encourage the submission of abstracts and full papers since preference will be given to their authors.

With best regards,



Secretariat of the BIOMAT Consortium.
