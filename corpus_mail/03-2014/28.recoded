Subject: [bioinfo] Hands-on bioinformatics training class at IBENS (Paris)



Dear colleagues,



The computational biology and bioinformatics platform at Institut de

Biologie de l'Ecole Normale SupÃ©rieure (IBENS) in Paris is organizing a

2-days hands-on bioinformatics training class dedicated to biologists

(targeted audience: wet-lab biologists/researchers). Please forward this

message around.



There are still a few places left. The course will be taught in English

or French, depending on the audience.



Dates: Tuesday 1st / Wednesday 2nd April



Day1: Using published high-throuput datasets

How to access, use and visualize published data?

Topics:

- accessing data in GEO from an accession number in a publication

- determine whether the data are raw data / processed data

- knowledge of the file standard (BED - BAM - WIG - BEDGRAPH ...)

- visualisation in UCSC browser

- ENCODE data



Day2: Gentle introduction to command-line usage

How to use the command-line to deal with high-throughput data ?

Topics:

- demystifying the command-line (it can be scary, but it's not harmful !)

- introduction to basic commands

- inputs / outputs

- opening big data files (> 1 Go)

- recipes for various tasks : counting sequences in fasta files,

selecting columns, specific rows in tabular files



Price:



1day 150euros, 2 days 250euros for Labex Memolife members (from IBENS,

CIRB or ESPCI).

1day 200euros, 2 days 350euros for other academics

1day 400euros, 2 days 700euros for industry attendees





Registration:

Contact Auguste Genovesio (auguste.genovesio@ens.fr) to register



Notes:

Morgane Thomas Chollier will be responsible for this training.

If you are interested in additional specific topics for future training,

feel free to contact Auguste Genovesio (auguste.genovesio@ens.fr)
