Subject: [bioinfo] Call for papers RECOMB-CG 2014



The Twelfth RECOMB Satellite Conference on Comparative Genomics

Oct 19-22, 2014

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, New York



URL: http://meetings.cshl.edu/meetingsregistration_recomb.asp



Venue: Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY.





The RECOMB-CG satellite workshop brings together leading researchers in

the mathematical, computational and life sciences to discuss cutting

edge research in comparative genomics, with an emphasis on computational

approaches and novel experimental results. The program includes both

invited speakers and contributed talks.



* Submission Deadline: June 27, 2014

* Author Notification: July 25, 2014

* Final Version Due: August 8, 2014

* Posters: TBA



The Twelfth RECOMB-CG will be held in Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,

Cold Spring Harbor, New York, USA. We invite high-quality original full

papers on topics related to comparative genomics. The submitted papers

must have not been published or under the consideration for publication

in any other journal or conference with formal proceedings. All accepted

papers will have to be presented by one on the authors at the

conference. Accepted papers will be invited to be published in the

journal BMC Genomics, following the publication policy of the journal.

Papers are solicited on, but not limited to, the following topics:



    =C2=B7 population genomics

    =C2=B7 genome rearrangement,

    =C2=B7 comparative tools for genome assembly

    =C2=B7 gene identification and/or annotation

    =C2=B7 comparison of functional networks

    =C2=B7 phylogenomics

    =C2=B7 genome variation

    =C2=B7 comparative epigenomics

    =C2=B7 genome evolution

    =C2=B7 paleogenomics

    =C2=B7 cancer evolution genomics
