Dear colleagues,



Here is some information a bout a forthcoming meeting in Barcelona,



Next Generation Sequencing Conference (NGS) 2014

June 2-4, 2014

Barcelona, Spain



http://www.iscb.org/ngs2014



Hosted by the International Society for Computational Biology (ISCB) and

the Centre for Genomic Regulation (CRG), the Next Generation Sequencing

Conference 2014 (NGS 2014) is a dedicated meeting on cutting-edge

approaches to the processing and analysis of Next Generation Sequencing

data. The goal of this conference is to bring together bioinformatics

researchers and biologists facing new high-throughput sequencing

challenges. The conference will feature presentations showing how

current platforms can be used to address key biological questions and

what is the current state of the art for data analysis. Sizeable space

will also be dedicated to emerging and future trends in high-throughput

sequencing and their associated computational challenges.



Topics include:



State of the art technologies, and technologies under development

Novel software and algorithms

Novel applications of NGS technologies in genomics and biology

Post genome sequencing analysis, including RNA analysis, transcription

factor binding sites profiling, histone modifications, nucleosome

positioning, copy number variation, genotyping, RNA structure, dynamics

of transcription and translation, etc.

Research breakthroughs based on exhaustive applications of NGS.

Clinical and translational applications

Applications to agriculture and biotechnology

Societal implications: forensic law, sociology research, history, etc.

Economical impacts

The conference will also aim to encompass the associated computational

challenges:



Novel algorithms, methods and pipelines

Comparative benchmarks of methods

Hardware developments specific to NGS

High performance computing in NGS

Computation in portable NGS devices, micro- and nano-NGS devices

Computation during data acquisition
