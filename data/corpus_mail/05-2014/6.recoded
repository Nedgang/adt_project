Subject: [bioinfo] ECCB 2014 tutorial "Computational Tools to Define and Analyse Logical Models of Cellular Networks"



We are pleased to announce the ECCB'14 tutorial on "Computational Tools to 
Define and Analyse Logical Models of Cellular Networks" that will take plac
e Sunday, 7th September, 2014 afternoon, in Strasbourg, France.



Looking forward to seeing you in Strasbourg,



C. Chaouiya, T. Cokelaer, T. Helikar and J. Saez-Rodriguez

Tutorial T02 - Logical Modelling and Analysis of Cellular Networks

             http://www.eccb14.org/program/tutorials/lmcn

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------



------------  Short description ------------



The logical framework is being increasingly used to model the dynamical beh
aviour of biological regulatory networks. In this context, a range of compu
tational tools have been developed to support model definition and analysis
. These tools reflect the diversity of formalisations covering =93logical m
odelling  (Boolean, multilevel, deterministic, stochastic, etc.). This tu
torial aims at providing an overview of this diversity, demonstrating the c
omplementarity between existing computational tools made possible by a nove
l exchange format --Systems Biology Markup Language  Qualitative Models (SB
ML qual). Instructors will provide an overview of existing technology power
ing efficient qualitative modelling of regulatory and signalling networks. 
Real biological examples will be used in the proposed tutorial session. Spe
cifically, presentations will cover the following topics:

- Brief introduction to logical modelling;

- Existing software tools and their specificities;

- SBML qual package, a standard format for model exchange;

- CellNOpt: a toolbox for creating logic-based models of signal transductio
n networks, and training them against high-throughput biochemical data (htt
p://www.cellnopt.org/), overview and short demo;

- GINsim, a software tool for the definition simulation and analysis of reg
ulatory and signalling networks (http://www.ginsim.org/), overview and shor
t demo;

- The Cell Collective, a platform for collaborative creation and simulation
 of large-scale Boolean models (http://www.thecellcollective.org/), overvie
w and short demo.



Attendees will have access to all the material necessary in order to follow
/reproduce the various short demonstrations. Speed dating will be organised
 along the main conference, for one-on-one hands-on training with attendees
' custom data.



--------- Target audience ---------



Students and researchers interested in learning a modelling approach to tac
kle the complexity of regulatory and signalling networks. This tutorial sho
uld interest not only new-comers to the field of network modelling, but als
o those already familiar with a particular tool, willing to learn about com
plementary approaches. No prior modelling experience is necessary.



---------- Instructors ---------



	- Claudine Chaouiya (Instituto Gulbenkian de CiÃªncia, Oeiras Portugal)

	- Thomas Cokelaer (EMBL-EBI, UK)

	- Tomas Helikar (University of Nebraska-Lincoln, USA)

	- Julio Saez-Rodriguez (EMBL-EBI, UK)



Note that this tutorial is coupled with the workshop "Logical Modelling and
 Analysis of Cellular Networks", on the previous day (Saturday, September 6
th, 2014, http://www.eccb14.org/program/workshops/lmacn).
