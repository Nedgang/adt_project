The Pervasiveness of Machine Learning in Omics Science

---------------- Description -------------------------------

Biology has become an enormously data-rich subject. Data is generated in 
many flavors and follows particularities of the omics perspective 
adopted along experimental studies. For instance, genomics is the field 
of study dealing with genomes and it is mostly associated with the 
static view (the genes and where they are placed along the genome). The 
dynamic view is brought from the transcriptomics perspective, so the 
gene expression and its regulation. Finally, interactomics is usually 
associated to gene products, proteins, and their interactions. However 
it could also be seen as a huge graph network with layers of interaction 
integrating distinct omics perspectives. Omics science applications of 
unsupervised and/or supervised machine learning (ML) techniques abound 
in the literature. In this tutorial, we discuss machine learning on 
omics data, putting the emphasis on (i) mapping and (ii) learning omics 
patterns. We consider three main omics data: genomics, transcriptomics 
and interactomics. For each perspective, we first provide, the 
biological problem, the data mapping (from a biological problem to a 
machine learning problem), the core ML methods employed and its 
implementation in the R language.

Draft outline:

:-: Introduction and overview of the omics science

:-: Machine learning in genomics data – foundations, methods and 
applications

:-: Machine learning in transcriptomics data – foundations, methods and 
applications

:-: Machine learning in interactomics data – foundations, methods and 
applications

:-: Outlook – summary and future challenges

Target audience:

The target groups are: graduate students with intermediate knowledge in 
machine learning/data mining; no previous knowledge in omics science is 
required; research scholars who work on machine learning to support 
bio-medicine and health care; practitioners that own applications on 
omics data.
