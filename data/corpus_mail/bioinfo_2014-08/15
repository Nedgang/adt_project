    REMINDER


The Gulbenkian Training Programme in Bioinformatics is happy to=20=20
announce that the

ABSTAT14 -  "Advanced Biostatistics for Bioinformatics Tool Users using R"

training course is open for applications

    IMPORTANT DATES for this Course
    Deadline for applications: September 5th 2014             <=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
    Latest acceptance notification: September 6th 2014        <=3D=3D=3D=3D=

    Course date: September 15th - 18th 2014

Attendance fee: Euro 320.00

Course description
This course is a standalone advanced Biostatistics course that can be=20=20
taken as a continuation of the Introductory Biostatistics for=20=20
Bioinformatics (IBSTAT) course that precedes it in GTPB. It is=20=20
targeted for Biostatistical techniques often employed in analytical=20=20
tools for high throughput data and multivariate data. Participants can=20=
=20
expect to attend a thorough set of lectures that will reveal the=20=20
conceptual frameworks that are needed to understand the methods.=20=20
Extensive hands-on practice will be the main vehicle for providing the=20=
=20
skills and user independence. To keep things in context, the course is=20=
=20
exclusively based on biological examples, worked with Bioinformatics=20=20
tools.
Care has been taken not to use any proprietary data or software, so=20=20
that the hands-on experience can carry on after the course, providing=20=20
maximum user independence. We will be using custom-built R scripts and=20=
=20
packages that are available from the CRAN and Bioconductor repositories.

Methodology
This intensive course will introduce a relatively high number of=20=20
concepts and methods. To keep it highly practical, we will spend most=20=20
of the time in hands-on sessions.
- We will focus on each method using examples taken from real world=20=20
Bioinformatics practice.
- We will then dissect the method, identifying the concepts and=20=20
exploring their interrelationships.
- The applicability and limitations of each method will be emphasized.
- The use of the method will be illustrated using appropriate=20=20
Bioinformatics tools and biological data resources.
------------------------------------------------------------

Due to the summer period, there will be little time to deal with the=20=20
applications, so the sooner you apply the better and we will do our=20=20
best to make the acceptance process run smoothly. Early acceptance=20=20
decisions will be the rule, not the exceptions, though you can help in=20=
=20
justifying why you need to know about it in advance (please use the=20=20
appropriate space in the Application Form).
