                    REMINDER

    IMPORTANT DATES for TA-AFADM14
    Deadline for applications: September 26th 2014       <=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
    Notification of acceptance dates:
         EARLY: Sept 19th 2014 (on special request, see Application)
         NORMAL: September 26th 2014
    Course date: October 6th - October 9th 2014

The Gulbenkian Training Programme in Bioinformatics is pleased to=20=20=20
announce that the applications for the hands-on Bioinformatics=20=20=20
training course

TA-AFADM14
Transcriptome Assembly, Automatic Annotation and Data Mining

are now OPEN. Please have a look at our website here:
http://gtpb.igc.gulbenkian.pt/bicourses/TA-AFADM14/

Course duration: 4 days
Course fee: Euro 320.00

We will have Stefan Goetz and Riccardo Alese Cigliano as instructors.
This course has already been run here several times with a great deal=20=20=
=20
of success, as revealed by very positive feedback reports and=20=20=20
subsequent recruitment by word of mouth by satisfied attendees.

Course description:

This is a combined course in RNA-seq and functional annotation aimed=20=20=
=20
at scientists working in next generation sequencing transcriptomics=20=20=
=20
who want to extract the best possible information from their data. The=20=
=20
  course covers all aspects of RNA-seq analysis, from quality control,=20=
=20
  to mapping, reconstruction of transcripts and differential=20=20
expression.  Participants will learn how to deal with RNA-seq data=20=20
both in the  presence and absence of a reference genome.

The second part of the course is a practical workshop on Blast2GO, the=20=
=20
  most popular framework for functional annotation of sequence data.=20=20=
=20
Participants will learn how to generate de novo functional labels,=20=20=20
such as GO terms and KEGG pathways, for their sequence data and how to=20=
=20
  extract relevant information from these annotations, i.e.=20=20=20
visualisation and enrichment analysis using the Gene Ontology. This=20=20=
=20
part will be based on the use of the Blast2GO application and will=20=20=20
mainly comprise exercises and practical cases. Participants may bring=20=20=
=20
their own data.

Who should attend? Experimentalists and bioinformaticians working on=20=20=
=20
EST, NextGeneration Sequencing and microarray design projects,=20=20=20
specially (but not exclusively) of non-model species. No programming=20=20=
=20
knowledge is required.

Thank you for your continued interest
