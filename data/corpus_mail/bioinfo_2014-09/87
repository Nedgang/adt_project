                    ANNOUNCEMENT

The Gulbenkian Training Programme in Bioinformatics is pleased to=20=20=20
announce that the applications for the hands-on Bioinformatics=20=20=20
training course

HPND14
Hunting for Promoters with NGS data

are now OPEN. Please have a look at our website here:
http://gtpb.igc.gulbenkian.pt/bicourses/HPND14/

We will have Edgar Wingender and Philip Stegmaier as instructors.

  Course description:

This course is set-up to review the basic principles of gene=20=20
regulation and the corresponding bioinformatic problems. It will start=20=
=20
with the computational prediction of promoters and distant enhancers=20=20
and will deal with the analysis of the structure of such regions by=20=20
identifying binding sites for transcription factors. The most=20=20
intriguing parts of genomes, still not completely understood, are the=20=20
gene regulatory regions =E2=80=93 mostly promoters and enhancers. A complet=
e=20=20
annotation of a newly sequenced genome has to address the=20=20
identification of these regions in addition to the classical task of=20=20
finding genes in terms of coding regions. Regulatory regions define=20=20
when, where and under what conditions genes become active and, thus,=20=20
are part of the fundamental function of a gene. In this course, we=20=20
will overview some of the experimental methods such as next generation=20=
=20
sequencing (NGS) techniques for genome-wide epigenetic analysis such=20=20
as ChIP-seq, which have revolutionized our ways for studying the gene=20=20
regulatory mechanisms. The attendees will learn about several=20=20
techniques of finding promoters and enhancers and the principles on=20=20
which these methods are based on. In the "hands on" exercises, several=20=
=20
analytical tools will be introduced and the results critically=20=20
evaluated to assess their reliability.


Objectives:

The course will consist of lectures that lay out the conceptual=20=20
framework as needed and and "hands on" exercises, which will provide=20=20
the practical insight on the use of the methods, gradually, in order=20=20
to produce skills that can be used with a relatively high degree of=20=20
independence. Participants will learn how to set-up some of the=20=20
programs, and use publicly available servers for more complex=20=20
analytical jobs, in an informed fashion, so that they fully understand=20=
=20
the output generated and how its quality can be assessed. Participants=20=
=20
will also learn the novel principles of organization of gene=20=20
regulatory regions, which will help them to interpret their results of=20=
=20
genomic and transcriptomic studies.




Thank you for your continued interest
