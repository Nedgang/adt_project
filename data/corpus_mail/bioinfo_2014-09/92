Subject: Alternative splicing: On the unicity of the solution to the varian=
t identification problem

New sequencing technologies can now be applied to the study of mRNA, throug=
h the RNA-seq protocol. These techniques yield large amounts of short reads=
, which then need to be reassembled to identify and quantify the full-lengt=
h mRNAs initially present in the sample. While this problem is simple when =
there is only one mRNA per gene, it becomes challenging when a gene gives r=
ises to several alternative splicing variants, with different exon content.=
 Recent studies estimate that up to 90% of multi-exon genes in human are al=
ternatively spliced. Hence, what was thought to be once an exception seems =
in fact to be the rule. Idenfifying and quantifying all the variants of a g=
ene is therefore a major challenge in the field, for which various methods =
have been proposed, including penalized regression approaches [Li et al., 2=
011, Bernard et al., 2014].

Unambiguously assigning an expression level to each variant is however not =
always possible, essentially because sequencing reads are short, and genes =
may have many (unannotated) variants Lacroix et al. [2008]. In practice, se=
veral sets of variants may give solutions which are equally good in terms o=
f penalized or constrained likelihood. Yet, most methods output only one be=
st solution, without mentionning that there could be other equally good one=
s. This is not satisfactory and could lead to spurious biological conclusio=
ns. The purpose of this post-doc is to carefully analyze the conditions und=
er which a solution is unique and, most importantly, when it is not the cas=
e to characterize the set of solutions and propose possibly unique sub-solu=
tions.

Context
The postdoctoral fellow will work either in the UMR 518 AgroParisTech-INRA =
de Math=C3=A9matiques et Informatique Appliquees (MIA) in Paris or in the U=
MR CNRS 5558 de Biom=C3=A9trie et de Biologie =C3=89volutive (LBBE) in Lyon=
. Both groups are specialized in statistics and bioinformatics.
This postdoctoral position is offered in the framework of ABS4NGS ANR proje=
ct https://sites. google.com/site/abs4ngs/. The postdoctoral fellow will th=
us discuss and collaborate with the different partners of this project Inst=
itut Curie and which started at the end of 2012.

Background
The applicant should have a strong background in applied statistics, bioinf=
ormatics and/or computer science; typically a PhD in one of these fields. A=
 strong experience in programming is also highly desirable.
