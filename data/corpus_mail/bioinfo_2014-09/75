Subject: [bioinfo] [Emploi][CDD/=?ISO-8859-1?Q?Ing=E9nieur?=] Bioinformatician for the analysis of non-coding RNAs in cancer

A 2-years Bioinformatics Research Assistant position is
available in the laboratory of Dr. Claire Rougeulle to study
long non-coding RNAs in cancer.
Starting Date: January 2015
The aim of the project is to systematically identify non-coding transcripts involved in tumor progression using a combination of human tumor samples and cellular models. It is a multi- team effort supported by the French National Alliance for Life and Health Science. The project involves:
1) Performing primary and secondary analysis of our RNA-seq data (quality control, alignment and differential expression analysis).
2) Performing de novo identification of long non-coding RNAs with ad hoc algorithms.
We are seeking strongly motivated, science-driven applicants with Masters in
informatics/bioinformatics. Applicants should have expertise in computational analyses and capacity to understand/develop scripts in Shell, R, Perl or Python. Expertise in high-throughput sequencing data analysis is a plus. The successful candidate will work in the group of Dr. Claire Rougeulle in the Department of Epigenetics and Cell Fate, at Paris Diderot University in Paris,
which offers a highly dynamic, international environment.

To apply, please send :
-curriculum vitae
-cover letter outlining your motivation
-names/contact information of two references.
