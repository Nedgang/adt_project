---------------- Description -------------------------------

The third International Society for Computational Biology Latin America X-Meeting on Bioinformatics with BSB and SoiBio (ISCB-Latin America) will take place in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, at the Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais on October 28 - 30, 2014.  This exciting conference is expected to attract over 450 top-notch researchers and students from around the globe.

The conference is comprised of exceptional keynote speakers, ample sessions developed from abstract submissions, and a large poster session.  There will also be an opportunity to publish selected papers in BMC Genomics.

The Brazilian Symposium on Bioinformatics 2014 is an initiative sponsored by the Sociedade Brasileira de Computação, and its special interest group in Computational Biology (CE-BioComp).

BSB provides a general forum for presentation and discussion of original research on COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY, BIOINFORMATICS and SYSTEMS BIOLOGY. BSB 2014 would like to attract contributions from academic and industrial researchers, both in the exact sciences (computer science, mathematics and statistics) and in the life sciences (molecular biology, biochemistry, genetics, medicine, microbiology and others).

BSB 2014 will accept both full papers (for oral presentation) and short papers (to be presented as posters). Proceedings containing accepted full papers will be published as a volume in the Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics series, from Springer. We also expect to have best papers invited for revised and expanded submission to a special issue in an international journal.
