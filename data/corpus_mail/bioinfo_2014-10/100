Subject: [bioinfo] Computational biology position at TOTAL - metabolic
 modeling/bioretrosynthesis

Computational Biology Scientist -  metabolic modeling / bioretrosynthesis

/10058926=20

TOTAL is one of the largest energy companies in the world, with over 97,000=
 employees, activities in more than 130 countries, and a division, TOTAL Ne=
w Energies, dedicated to the commercial development of renewable energies (=
photovoltaics, concentrated solar energy, advanced biofuels and biotechnolo=
gy). TOTAL New Energies pursues differentiation through technology as the f=
irst step towards building competitive integrated industrial operations in =
these renewable energies. TOTAL's Biotechnology R&D Department is responsib=
le for developing advanced biofuels and chemicals from renewable resources =
and leverages R&D partnerships with innovative start-ups (e.g. Amyris, Novo=
gy), top class research institutes (e.g. Joint BioEnergy Institute JBEI) an=
d academic labs. This open network of partnerships enables it to design, de=
velop, and assemble technologies that could make a real difference in the n=
ear or mid-term future.=20

In an effort to further boost the development of renewable products inside =
the Group, TOTAL is opening a joint R&D laboratory in Solaize (France) betw=
een its New Energies (NE) and its Marketing & Services (M&S) branches. This=
 laboratory will join in a pioneering manner the product and market experti=
se of the M&S branch with the cutting-edge know-how in biotechnology and ch=
emical processes of the NE branch. It will tackle the exciting challenge of=
 significantly expanding the portfolio of bio-sourced, sustainable products=
 developed by TOTAL, while maintaining or improving their level of performa=
nce.

TOTAL is seeking an enthusiastic, creative, and team-oriented computational=
 biology scientist to support the development of this ambitious laboratory.=
 He/she will contribute to the development of bioproducts computational des=
ign tools and will be the main developer of bioretrosynthesis approaches. T=
hese approaches will consist in exploring the wealth of biochemical transfo=
rmations - through state-of-the-art computational modeling and data mining =
- to design efficient biochemical conversion routes toward the biomolecules=
 of interest for TOTAL M&S. As such, the computational biology scientist wi=
ll interact closely with scientists in other areas of the laboratory (chemi=
sts, process engineers, analytics scientists, computational chemistry scien=
tists), so as to best integrate constraints on product design and performan=
ce in the bioretrosynthesis approaches.

Backed by strong backgrounds in biotechnology, biochemistry, data analysis =
and computer science, the computational biology scientist will be equally f=
luent at imagining innovative methods, implementing robust computational in=
frastructure, and communicating / exchanging ideas with other members of th=
e laboratory and of the company. The position will be at the heart of TOTAL=
's new renewable products design and will therefore involve as well signifi=
cant interactions with other members and projects of the New Energies Biote=
chnology R&D department.

Key responsibilities
-	Conceive and implement computational methods designing biochemical transf=
ormation routes that convert biomass feedstock into target biomolecules.=20
-	Collaborate closely with scientists of the laboratory to integrate constr=
aints on product design and performance in the bioretrosynthesis methods. I=
n particular, tailor the methods to the types of molecules targeted by the =
laboratory and leverage QSPR predictions to identify the most promising mol=
ecules based on their properties.
-	Propose and implement relevant criteria for selecting the most promising =
transformation routes: novelty, performance of production, estimated cost o=
f production, etc.=20
-	Develop a robust software infrastructure implementing metabolic modeling =
and bioretrosynthesis methods.
-	Apply the bioretrosynthesis methods to molecules of interests for TOTAL M=
&S. Rank predicted routes by relevance. Help conceive R&D development plans=
 for the biotechnological routes deemed most promising.
-	Contribute to the development of a robust computational biology infrastru=
cture for the joint NE/M&S laboratory as well as for the New Energies Biote=
chnology R&D department.
-	Communicate and report on scientific results.

Required qualifications
Education
-	PhD in Computational Biology, Systems Biology or Synthetic Biology.
Knowledge and experience
-	Strong experience in computational biology and large-scale modeling of me=
tabolism and synthetic pathways. In particular, excellent knowledge of tool=
s used to build genome-scale metabolic networks, analyze intracellular flux=
 distributions, explore public bioinformatics databases.
-	Excellent knowledge of biochemistry, microbiology, metabolic engineering.
-	Proven experience in software development. Expert coder in Python, R/Matl=
ab, and/or C/C++.
-	Strong ability to organize and manage large amounts of heterogeneous data=
. Experience with databases, SQL, and schema design will be as strong asset.
-	Good knowledge of statistical methods. Experience with machine learning w=
ould be a plus.
-	Good knowledge of numerical optimization methods, in particular for const=
rained optimization problems (LP, QP, MILP).
-	Ability to work in a multidisciplinary environment, in particular at the =
interface with Systems Biology, Synthetic Biology, Metabolic Engineering, M=
icrobiology, Biochemistry, Chemistry, Process Engineering.
-	A proven track-record of innovative research through achievements, public=
ations and/or patents.
-	Fluent in English.
Personal qualities
-	Creative ;  excellent analytical and problem solving capabilities
-	Capacity to take initiative and be proactive
-	Good interpersonal skills, team-player
-	Clear communication skills.
