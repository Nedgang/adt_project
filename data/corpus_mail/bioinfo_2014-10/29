Subject: [bioinfo] Deadline approaching: Lyon SysBio, 19-21 November

LyonSysBio (http://lyonsysbio.sciencesconf.org/) is the yearly
international conference organized by the Systems Biology Alliance of
Lyon/ BioSyL.

Its goal is to promote exchanges between scientists from different
disciplines (biology, mathematics, computer sciences, physics, social
sciences,…) who are interested in the analysis of the wealth of data
generated by modern biology, as well as the construction of the necessary
modeling tools to gain system level thoughtful insights.

In 2014, this conference will be held from the 19th to the 21th of
November. It will be dedicated to discussions around the 4 following
themes: Morphogenesis, Ecosystems and population dynamics, Phenotypic
outcomes of stochasticity and Regulatory networks.

Keynote lectures will be delivered by invited speakers, on
state-of-the–art advances on those themes. In addition, the conference
program will leave ample space for contributed talks and posters for which
proposals are welcome.

On November 19, Meet the Industry, a satellite meeting jointly organized
with ECOFECT will offer a unique opportunity for private and public
researchers to share ideas in a stimulating environment.
