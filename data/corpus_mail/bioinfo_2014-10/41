Subject: [bioinfo] Summer school: whole cell modeling

Whole-cell modeling summer school
March 9-13, 2015 | Rostock, Germany


We are pleased to announce the hackathon-style summer school to be held nex=
t year in Rostock, Germany, with the aim of developing an open version of t=
he Karr et al. whole-cell model (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2281789=
8).

The primary aim for the participants of the summer school is to learn about=
 standards for modelling and simulation in computational biology.  But a se=
condary aim is to enjoy modelling, coding and diagramming the whole-cell mo=
del using openly available software and COMBINE standards (http://co.mbine.=
org).

An anticipated outcome of the event is a roadmap for future developments ne=
eded in the different standardisation efforts involved in the summer school=
.  Together, we want to answer the important question: "What is missing in =
today's standards?"  We believe this will help provide guidelines for COMBI=
NE.

In total, we will accept up to 50 students (PhD to early postdoc level), wh=
o will be fully funded through the Volkswagen Foundation. The application f=
orm is open until the 31st of October.

Details of the summer school are available from the following website:

Please consider putting up our poster in your institutions (https://sites.g=
oogle.com/site/vwwholecellsummerschool/documents), and please also feel fre=
e to forward this e-mail to potentially interested colleagues.
