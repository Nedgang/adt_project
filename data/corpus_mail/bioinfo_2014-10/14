Subject: [bioinfo] 2 PhD positions at Zurich


De la part de Maria Anisimova :

Two Ph.D. student positions in computational science and phylogenetics

Two three-year Ph.D. studentships in computational science and 
phylogenetics are available jointly at the University of Zurich (UZH) 
and the Zurich University of Applied Sciences (ZHAW). The research 
project will focus on computational and statistical aspects of the 
alignment and phylogenetic tree estimation.

The project is collaboration between the Applied Computational Genomics 
group of Maria Anisimova (Institute of Applied Simulations, ZHAW) and 
Manuel Gil in the Bioinformatics and Systems Biology group of Christian 
von Mering (Institute of Molecular Life Sciences, UZH). Both groups have 
wide ranging expertise in computational biology. In addition, the 
candidates will benefit from the group membership in the Swiss Institute 
of Bioinformatics, providing further training and networking opportunities.

The successful candidate will have a strong background in computational 
science, including computational statistics, algorithmics, statistical 
estimation procedures, and numerical analysis. Fluency in a 
multi-paradigm programming language like C++ is required. Previous 
knowledge in phylogenetics is a plus but is not required. The candidate 
is expected to develop a background in phylogenetics and molecular 
evolution.

We are looking for an individual with a masters degree or equivalent, 
who is highly self-motivated and can work independently. The working 
language in the team is English. German skills, although helpful for 
day-to-day life, are not essential. Ideally, the candidate would be able 
to start on the 1st of February 2015.

To be considered, please send a single (!) PDF file merged from the 
following parts to maria.anisimova@zhaw.ch: CV including publication 
list (if available), a scanned academic transcript (list of grades in 
university courses), a motivation statement not exceeding two pages, and 
three references. Please include "JATI2014" in the subject line of your 
email. The application deadline is the 1st of November 2014, but the 
candidates will be considered until the positions are filled.
