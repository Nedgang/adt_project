Subject: [bioinfo] 2 Postdoctoral Positions at CEA



The CEA (Commisariat à l’Energie Atomique et aux Energies Alternatives), 
in order to sustain its research activities on Genetics and Personalized 
Medicine is initiating a new flagship program at the frontier between 
biology and information technologies. As part of this iniative, the 
CEA/DSV/IG/CNG (Institut de Génomique – Centre National de Génotypage) 
and the CEA/DRT/LIST (Direction de la Recherche Technologique – Systèmes 
numériques intelligents) are offering 2 postdoctoral positions to 
develop computational approaches/pipelines to integrate and analyze 
large scale genomics data for diagnostic purposes.

Following recent advances in high throughput sequencing, it is expected 
that, in the near future, more and more individuals will have their 
whole genome extracted, stored and analyzed in a routine fashion. 
Although this perspective is full of promises in terms of personalized 
preventive and curative medicine, as well as medical research, it raises 
different technological and methodological challenges to be solved 
before genome sequencing being a routine diagnostic solution. In this 
context, the CEA aims to develop a platform to analyze, store and 
process the genomes able to scale up with the growth of the generated data.

1/ Post-Doctoral Fellowship: Clinical Genomics:
The postdoctoral holder will define and participate to the development 
of an analytical workflow to interpret whole genome sequencing. He will 
have to:
- Define an analytical workflow (pipelines) to predict diagnostic status 
based on sequencing and defined markers. For this task, he will have to 
explore impact of technological biases on the clinical predictions 
(sequencing coverage issues, reproducibilty issues) and uncertainty 
about clinically reportable findings.
- Build a reference genotype/phenotype knowledge database by integrating 
and curating different resources (pubmed, HGMD, clinVar, Omim, Cosmics…).
- Implement, in collaboration with bioinformaticians from the CNG 
(Centre National de Génotypage, Evry) and mathematicians from the LIST, 
a full prototype demonstrating robustness, scalability, and security.
The position is located at Evry (CEA, Centre National de Genotypage). 
Successful candidates will join a young and multidisciplinary 
bioinformatics team playing a central role in the development of novel 
genomics approaches. The postdoc will be engaged into active 
collaborations with fundamentals (math, statistics, computational) 
groups located at Palaiseau (about 30 kms).

We are seeking individuals with a strong background in genomics and/or 
computer sciences, and expertise with biological data-handling, 
modeling, and bioinformatics. Additional background in clinical genetics 
would be appreciated.

2/ Post-Doctoral Fellowship: Optimized variants calling by integration 
of supervised and unsupervised methods:

Detection of variants in the human genome is usually based on mapping of 
reads on a reference genome. However parts of genomes are very complex 
and changing for one individual to another and mapping based approach 
are not sufficient. In this case, it has been proposed to integrate 
mapping based approaches to assembly based methods [Rimmer14]. This 
approach is very promising but still presents some limits such as the 
size of reads to be aligned. An example of unsupervised methods is De 
Bruijn graph to represent overlapping information in reads. This type of 
graph could be generalized to several samples into “colored De Bruijn 
Graph” [Iqbal12]. These are promising methods but there are still some 
open questions to apply it in complex zones such as HLA (human leukocyte 
antigen).
The position is located at Saclay (CEA LIST). Successful candidates will 
join a young and multidisciplinary applied mathematics team.
The postdoc will be engaged into active collaborations with the 
bioinformatics team of (Centre National de Genotypage) located at Evry 
(about 30 kms).
We are seeking PhD in applied Mathematics with a strong background in 
optimization and graph theory. Additional background in genetics would 
be appreciated.
Candidates with a strong qualification and experience can also be 
eligible to the CEA Enhanced Eurotalents program funded by the European 
Commission and operated by CEA to promote and to support the mobility of 
scientists.
