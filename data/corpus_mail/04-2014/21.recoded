Subject: [bioinfo] IEEE BIBM 2014 Call for Workshop Proposals (IEEE International
 Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine)


Call for Workshop Proposals

2014 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine
http://scm.ulster.ac.uk/~bibm/2014/index.html
November 2-5, 2014, Belfast, UK
=================================================================
The Program Committees of the 2014 IEEE International Conference on 
Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (IEEE BIBM 2014) invite proposals for 
Workshops.  Selected workshops will hold a central position within the 
larger Conference, which will bring together top academic and industrial 
researchers from all over the world to exchange cutting edge research 
ideas in bioinformatics and biomedicine.  Within these fields, workshops 
at BIBM form crucial focal points for emerging communities and forums 
for the examination of new ideas.
Workshop organizers will be responsible for advertising the workshop, 
forming the program committees, reviewing and selecting the papers, and 
guaranteeing a high quality worthy of the prestige and breadth of the 
Conference.  All papers accepted for workshops will be included in the 
Workshop Proceedings published by the IEEE Computer Society Press, made 
available at the Conference.

The workshop organizers will also have the discretion of editing 
selected papers (after their expansion and revision) into books or 
special journal issues.  Workshops should cover at least a single 
session (6 regular papers). The workshop organizers should ensure 
registration and presence of   authors of accepted papers.

Workshop Topics
Each workshop subject will focus on new research challenges and 
initiatives in Bioinformatics,  Biomedicine and Healthcare Informatics.  
The workshops should provide an informal and vibrant forum for 
researchers and industry practitioners to share their research results 
and practical development experiences in these three fields.  Workshop 
topics may be narrow, e.g., “reverse-engineering” of  gene regulatory 
networks from experimental data, computational approaches to drug 
discovery, mathematical modeling of signaling pathways, analysis of the 
next-generation sequencing data, oscillations and synchronization of 
biological rhythms, wireless sensor networks, patient health records, 
medical signal processing; or broad, e.g., computational proteomics, 
in-silico diagnosis and prognosis, data mining and machine learning 
algorithms for biomedical applications, application of network research 
to biology, emerging technology in healthcare, aging research etc.  
Prospective workshop organizers
  are encouraged to contact workshop chairs for feedback.
Important Dates
May 1, 2014: Workshop proposal submission due:
              a proposed workshop announcement is  sent by e-mail to any 
of the  Workshop Chairs
May 20, 2014: Notification to workshop proposers
June 25, 2014: Each workshop organizer sends out Call for Workshops 
Papers




Guidelines for Workshop Proposals

importance, purpose, interests, etc. of workshop)
3. Research topics included in the workshop (list a number of 
interesting topics or areas covered by workshop)
