 Oeiras, Portugal







             GTPB Announcement



Applications are open for another Bioinformatics Training course:



SMLMC14

Structural Modeling for Large Macromolecular Complexes

with Joanna Kasprzak and Grzegorz Chojnowski



    IMPORTANT DATES for this Course

    Deadline for applications: May 15st 2014

    Latest notification of acceptance: May 17th 2014

    Course date: June 11th - June 13th 2014





Course description

One of the major challenges in structural biology is to determine the


structures of macromolecular complexes and to understand their

function and mechanism of action. However, structural characterisation


  of macromolecular assemblies is very difficult. To begin addressing


this problem, we have developed PyRy3D.

In a nutshell, PyRy3D employs a hybrid computational approach that

incorporates spatial information from a variety of experimental

methods into the modelling procedure to build low-resolution models of


  large macromolecular complexes. The PyRy3D model building procedure


uses a Monte Carlo approach to sample the solutions-space. It uses

spatial restraints to define components interacting with each other,


and a simple scoring function is applied to pack them tightly into

contours of the entire complex (e.g. cryoEM density maps).
