Subject: [bioinfo] 2 year-tenured track research position at the institute of Systems & Synthetic Biology (iSSB, Evry, France)

A 2 year-tenured track research position is available at the institute of S=
ystems & Synthetic Biology (iSSB, Evry, France).

iSSB is the only French lab dedicated to Synthetic Biology whose research a=
ctivities aim at designing, constructing and characterizing biosafe synthet=
ic gene circuits for therapeutic applications. Chemists, physicists, comput=
ational and molecular biologists, and computer scientists work on

            - orthogonal gene synthesis,

            - metabolic modeling and engineering,

            - spatio-temporal circuits for gene regulation,

            - operon characterization and engineering, or

            - genome engineering for animal model developments.

 All projects are funded by National and European funding agencies, or by G=
enopole=AE (first and largest French consortium of leading research academi=
c and private laboratories in genomics, post-genomics and related sciences).

The candidate should have a Ph.D. in biology, computational sciences or phy=
sical sciences, and experience in systems or synthetic biology. He(she) sho=
uld have studied in France and should be currently abroad. iSSB team leader=
s will select applicants which will be ranked by our Scientific Advisory Bo=
ard (www.issb.fr).

 The job location is in Evry, 35 km south of Paris, 30 min by commuter trai=
n. Applicants should send their CV, a cover letter, a report on past and fu=
ture research activities, and three names of references to the Synthetic Bi=
ology Recruiting Committee: sb-recruiting@issb.genopole.fr, 331 69 47 44 39=
, fax 331 69 47 44 37.
