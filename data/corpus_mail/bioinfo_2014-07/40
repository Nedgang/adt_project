Call for Postdoctoral Fellow/Research Associate in Robotics-inspired
Techniques for Protein and Peptide Modeling

George Mason University
Department of Computer Science
PI: Amarda Shehu

I am looking for a highly motivated postdoctoral fellow to lead a
research project funded by the National Science Foundation. The project
aims to extend the capability of robotics-inspired algorithms
characterize motions and dynamics of flexible peptides and proteins. The
emphasis is on novel algorithm design, but someone with prior experience
in molecular geometry and protein structure modeling is ideal for the
position. The position is for two years. Based on qualifications and
past experience, the candidate may be offered a research associate
position.


Applications are being accepted now and will continue until the position
is filled.

The candidate should have:

- Ph.D. in Computer Science
- Prior experience and expertise designing robot motion planning algorithms

- Excellent programming skills in C++
- Prior experience with protein and peptide structure geometry and modeling

- Some familiarity with physics-based molecular modeling packages, such
as AMBER

Starting date: January 2015


How to apply:
Submit CV and names and emails of 2-3 references via email

To apply or for more information, please contact:
