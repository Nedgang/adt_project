(=93BACterial Hosts for production of Bioactive phenolics from=20
bERRY fruits"), we are seeking for one postdoc candidate,=20
for one year renewable for up to two years.=20

The BacHBerry project is interested in the generation of=20
bacterial platforms for sustainable bio-based production of=20
phenolic compounds found in berry fruits. Phenolics are=20
recognised for their antioxydant health-promoting and functional=20
properties, and applied across applications as diverse as=20

different bacteria in interaction. Both approaches will be=20
explored.=20

Ideally, the candidate should have a strong background in at=20
least one of: biochemistry, systems biology of bacterial=20
communities, metabolic bioengineering; together with an=20
interest and some expertise in the use and development of=20
