Course description

This course is a standalone advanced Biostatistics course that can be

taken as a continuation of the Introductory Biostatistics for

Bioinformatics (IBSTAT) course that precedes it in GTPB. It is

targeted for Biostatistical techniques often employed in analytical

tools for high throughput data and multivariate data. Participants can


expect to attend a thorough set of lectures that will reveal the

conceptual frameworks that are needed to understand the methods.

Extensive hands-on practice will be the main vehicle for providing the


skills and user independence. To keep things in context, the course is


exclusively based on biological examples, worked with Bioinformatics

tools.

Care has been taken not to use any proprietary data or software, so

that the hands-on experience can carry on after the course, providing

maximum user independence. We will be using custom-built R scripts and


packages that are available from the CRAN and Bioconductor repositories.



Methodology

This intensive course will introduce a relatively high number of

concepts and methods. To keep it highly practical, we will spend most

of the time in hands-on sessions.

- We will focus on each method using examples taken from real world

Bioinformatics practice.

- We will then dissect the method, identifying the concepts and

exploring their interrelationships.

- The applicability and limitations of each method will be emphasized.

- The use of the method will be illustrated using appropriate

Bioinformatics tools and biological data resources.

------------------------------------------------------------



Due to the summer period, there will be little time to deal with the

applications, so the sooner you apply the better and we will do our

best to make the acceptance process run smoothly. Early acceptance

decisions will be the rule, not the exceptions, though you can help in


justifying why you need to know about it in advance (please use the

appropriate space in the Application Form).
