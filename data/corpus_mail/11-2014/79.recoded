Subject: [bioinfo] Mathematical and Computational Evolutionary Biology, 21-25 June 2015
 - Porquerolles

MCEB - Mathematical and Computational Evolutionary Biology
21-25 June 2015 - Porquerolles Island, South of France.

Webpage: http://www.lirmm.fr/mceb2015/

Pre-registration deadline: February 10th
Notification to applicants: February 28th
Final list of attendees: April 1st

Scope: Mathematical and computational tools and concepts form
an essential basis for modern evolutionary studies. The goal
of the MCEB conference (at its 7th edition) is to bring together
scientists with diverse backgrounds to present recent advances
and discuss open problems in the field of mathematical and
computational evolutionary biology. The theme of this year's
edition will be new data, new questions, new methods. New
generation sequencing techniques have multiplied not just
the amount, but also the types of genetic data produced,
giving rise to new questions, and new methodologies to answer
them. These methodologies are often cross-disciplinary, with
applications to diverse research topics. General concepts, models,
methods and algorithms will also be presented and discussed,
just as during the previous conference editions.

Where and when: Porquerolles Island, near Hy√®res, in the
South of France, 21-25 June 2015.

Cost: Conference fees including accommodation for four nights,
meals, coffee breaks, etc., will be between 300 euros  and 630 euros , all
inclusive, and will vary depending on the room. PhD students
and postdocs will benefit of the cheapest rooms.
