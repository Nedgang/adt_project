Subject: [bioinfo] [ECCB'14] Call for abstracts: Workshop on Disease Comorbidity

We are pleased to announce the ECCB'14 satellite workshop dedicated to "Com=
putational and Systems Biology for Disease Comorbidities" that will take pl=
ace Sunday, 7th September, 2014, in Strasbourg, France.

The workshop will be organized around 3 sessions scoping the discovery, the=
 interpretation and the exploitation of disease comorbidities. Key invited =
speakers will introduce each session and speakers selected from abstract su=
bmissions will broaden the overview of the science currently developed in t=
his field.

We deeply encourage you to submit abstracts to the workshop here:
https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dcsbdc2014

Informations on the workshop can be found here:
http://www.eccb14.org/program/workshops/csbdc


Keydates
Abstract submission deadline: 15th, May 2014
Workshop: 7th, September 2014

Looking forward to seeing you in Strasbourg,=20

############# Workshop Description


Disease comorbidity =96 or multimorbidity =96 exists if 2 or more disorders=
 affect the same individuals more often than expected by chance. Such co-oc=
currence of diseases are the rule rather than the exception, in particular =
in ageing populations. Disease comorbidities hence represent a major burden=
 in public health, and greatly affect disease costs and outcomes. But the r=
ecent expansion of large-scale biomedical databases and post-genomics disea=
se-related datasets are now offering an unprecedented avenue for the invest=
igations on comorbidities between human disorders. And Computational and Sy=
stems Biology are undeniable actors of such investigations.


Session 1: Discovering Disease Comorbidities
The first session of the workshop will be dedicated to the different approa=
ches that can lead to the detection of comorbidities between disorders, suc=
h as the parsing of clinical and epidemiological data.

Confirmed speakers:
S=F8ren Brunak, CBS, Copenhague, Denmark
Maria Martinez, INSERM, Toulouse, France

Session 2: Interpreting Disease Comorbidities
The second session of the workshop will be dedicated to the network-based a=
pproaches developed to interpret at the molecular levels the comorbidities =
between human disorders. Many data and multi-scale approaches studying the =
entangled molecular relationships between proteins, diseases and/or phenoty=
pes rely on network representations. Phenotypes proximities between disease=
s can arise from mutations in functionally similar genes, for instance gene=
s coding for proteins involved in the same pathways that are close in a pro=
tein interaction network.=20

Confirmed speaker:
Ioannis Xenarios, SBI, Lausanne, Switzerland

Session 3: Exploiting Disease Comorbidities
A major interest for the study of disease comorbidities lies in the therape=
utic road of drug repurposing (or repositioning). The knowledge on disease =
comorbidities could drive drug repositioning in a more effective way than s=
ystematic screenings. This assumption is the rationale of the last session.

Confirmed speaker:
Patrick Aloy, IRB, Barcelona, Spain
