Subject: [bioinfo] Call for abstracts: Regulatory Genomics Special Interest Group (RegGenSIG)

FYI: http://light.ece.ohio.edu/~reggen/2014/



*Regulatory Genomics Special Interest Group (RegGenSIG)*
Special Interest Group (SIG) at ISMB 2014 <http://www.iscb.org/ismb2014>
July 12, 2014, Boston, Massachusetts
SIG Hours: 8:30 a.m - 6:00 p.m.


Regulatory genomics involves the study of the genomic 'control system,'
which determines how, when and where to activate the 'blueprint' encoded
in the genome. Regulatory genomics is the topic of much research
activity worldwide. Since computational methods are important in the
study of gene regulation, the RegGenSIG meeting focuses on
bioinformatics for regulatory genomics. An important goal of the meeting
is to foster a collaborative community wherein scientists convene to
solve difficult research problems in all areas of computational
regulatory genomics.

RegGenSIG will include presentations and posters that cover the broad
spectrum of topics important to regulatory genomics research. The goal
is to bring together experts in experimental methods and computational
methods to consider sequence-based reconstruction of regulatory networks
and prediction of gene expression. Topics to be addressed in the SIG
include the following:

 1. inference of gene regulatory networks;
 2. utilization of information pertaining to epigenetics, chromatin
    structure, and histone modifications;
 3. determination of the roles of regulatory RNAs;
 4. prediction of transcriptional regulation from RNA-seq data and
    ChIP-seq data;
 5. pattern discovery in sequences; and
 6. sequence based modeling of gene expression.


      CALL FOR EXTENDED ABSTRACTS

To make an oral presentation at RegGenSIG, extended abstracts should be
submitted by April 27, 2014 to sinhas@illinois.edu
<mailto:sinhas@illinois.edu>, including "RegGen Abstract Oral" in the
subject line. An abstract should be a maximum of 3 pages excluding
bibliography. Authors will be notified by May 8, 2014.


      CALL FOR POSTERS

For poster presentations, authors should submit a 250 word abstract no
later than May 18, 2014 to sinhas@illinois.edu
<mailto:sinhas@illinois.edu>, including "RegGen Abstract Poster" in the
subject line. Authors will be notified no later than May 25, 2014.
