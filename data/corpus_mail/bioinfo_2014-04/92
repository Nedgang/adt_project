Subject: [bioinfo] BioNetVisA workshop at ECCB'14 in Strasbourg

BioNetVisA workshop: From biological network reconstruction to data visualization and analysis in molecular biology and medicine.

The workshop will take place in Strasbourg, France, on September 7th, 2014 as part of the European Conference on Computational Biology ECCB’14

The abstracts submission for talks and posters is open now (the deadline is on May 15th)
https://sysbio.curie.fr/bionetvisa
http://www.eccb14.org/program/workshops/bionetvisa

A travel fellowship for funding participation of young researchers will be available. Priority will be given to selected speakers.

Scope:
One day workshop, BioNetVisA will be focused on computational pathway analysis, applications in research, clinics, biotech and beyond. 

The goal of BioNetVisA workshop is to build a discussion around:
- Approaches for biological knowledge formalisation, data integration and analysis.
- Compatibility between different methods and biological networks resources available in the field.
- Applicability for concrete research and clinical projects based on high-throughput data.
- Accessibility of available tools for wide range of user in every-day standalone application in biological, clinical and biotech labs.

The workshop is suitable for wide audience as database providers, networks creators, computational and experimental biologists, clinicians and anyone who is interested to be exposed to the different paradigms of network biology and the latest achievements in the field.
