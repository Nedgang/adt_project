Subject: [bioinfo] NETTAB 2014 & Crystal (cl)Year 2014, October 16-17, 2014, Torino,
 Italy

Dear SFBI members,

in the hope that it can be of your interest, I'm sending you some 
information on next NETTAB 2014 workshop and its joint meeting "2014: 
Crystal (cl)Year".

As you will see, the workshop will be held in Torino, quite near to the 
French border indeed, from October 16 to 17, 2014, at the Molecular 
Biotechnology Center (MBC) of the local University.

The main theme of the NETTAB 2014 is "From high-throughput structural 
bioinformatics to integrative systems biology".
Main topics relate to methods, tools, applications, and perspectives on 
structural bioinformatics, proteomics and integrative systems biology.

We have already agreed with BMC for the post workshop publication of two 
supplements of BMC Bioinformatics and of BMC Systems Biology including 
selected full papers from the workshop.

A synthesis of the main information is reported here below.

You will find the complete call for abstracts and much more information 
in the events' web sites:
NETTAB 2014: http://www.nettab.org/2014/
CCY 2014: http://www.nettab.org/2014/CCY/

I hope you will be interested in submitting and attending.

Please don't hesitate to ask for any further information.

Best regards.

Paolo Romano
