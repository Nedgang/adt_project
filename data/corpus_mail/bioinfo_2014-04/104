Subject: [bioinfo] Seminaire Art Olson - lundi 5 mai 14h00, IBPC


Chers collegues,

Le lundi 5 mai a 14h00 se tiendra un seminaire assez "interactif" de
Art Olson, connu pour son logiciel autodock, du Scripps Research=20
Institute a l'IBPC [1].=20

 =AB Interacting with Protein Interactions =BB

Biology has become accessible to an understanding of processes that span
from atom to organism.  As such we now have the opportunity to build a
spatio-temporal picture of living systems at the molecular level.  In
our recent work we attempt to create, interact with, and communicate
physical representations of complex molecular environments.

I will discuss the challenges and demonstrate three levels of
interaction with protein interactions: 1) human perceptual and cognitive
interaction with complex structural information; 2) interaction and
integration of multiple data sources to construct cellular environments
at the molecular level; and 3) interaction of software tools that can
bridge the disparate disciplines needed to explore, analyze and
communicate a holistic molecular view of living systems.

In order to increase our understanding and interaction with complex
molecular structural information we have combined two evolving computer
technologies, 3D printing and augmented reality. We create custom
tangible molecular models and track their manipulation with real-time
video, superimposing text and graphics onto the models to enhance their
information content and to drive interactive computation.

We have recently developed automated technologies to construct the
crowded molecular environment of living cells from structural
information at multiple scales as well as as bioinformatics information
on levels of protein expression and other data.  We can populate
cytoplasm, membranes, and organelles within the same structural volume
to generate cellular environments that synthesize our current knowledge
of such systems.

The communication of complex structural information requires extensive
scientific knowledge as well as expertise in creating clear
visualizations.  We have developed a method of combining scientific
modeling environments with professional grade 3D modeling and animation
programs such as Maya, Cinema4D and Blender.  This gives both scientists
and professional illustrators access to the best tools to communicate
the science and the art of the molecular cell.
