POSTDOCTORAL  FELLOWSHIP in COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCE / BIOINFORMATICS

--
Employer

The research team "Genetics & Genomics " in the PEGASE laboratory, composed of INRA researchers and AGROCAMPUS OUEST lecturers and researchers, is seeking for a post-doctoral fellow in computational science / bioinformatics.

--
Project Description

This postdoctoral fellowship is a part of the GenInnov project, funded by the Brittany region as part of a call for projects “Strategy of Sustainable Action”. The GenInnov project aims to develop tools for training and research in the field of genomic selection.

The GenInnov project forms part of the partnership with EVOLUTION, a leader in the bovine animal breeding in France with more than 1000 employees, located in Rennes. The objective is the development of a genomic analysis workflow of the relationship between genotypes and phenotypes. More specifically, this second will consist to modify and/or develop tools in order to 1) manage the data, 2) identify QTL regions and 3) provide the functional annotation of the regions of interest. This workflow will be used by the research team for existing and future research projects, for research projects in collaboration with the company EVOLUTION during the scholarship of Agrocampus students and in the future collaborations of the research team.
