> The First Bordeaux Workshop on Bio-Informatics of Personalised Treatment =
of Cancer will take place on the 20th of June 2014.
>=20
> Sequencing revolution is making increasingly possible to use genomic info=
rmation in the clinical practice for cancer treatment. It is particularly s=
alient in the design of clinical trial stratification strategies, with the =
ultimate goal being to adjust cancer treatment to genomic profile of a pati=
ent. Both quantity and complexity of the available information make bioinfo=
rmatics an essential part in most steps of this new personalised treatment =
approach.

> The workshop is free of charge, but you have to register by sending an e-=
mail to macha@labri.fr and R.Iggo@bordeaux.unicancer.fr.
> Before 30th of May we will go through the registration list and send you =
a confirmation for participation. This will be done on the first come first=
