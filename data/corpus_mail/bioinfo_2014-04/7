Subject: [bioinfo] PhD position at INRIA Grenoble - =?ISO-8859-1?Q?Rh=F4ne?=-Alpes on Modelling and estimation of gene expression variability in single cells

PhD position at INRIA Grenoble - Rhône-Alpes, France

MODELLING AND ESTIMATION OF GENE EXPRESSION VARIABILITY IN SINGLE CELLS

In the context of the INRIA 2014 recruitment campaign, a PhD position in 
the field of gene expression modelling is proposed at INRIA Grenoble - 
Rhône -Alpes (France).
The subject of the PhD is the estimation of gene expression dynamics in 
individual cells from fluorescence microscopy experiments, with 
perspective applications such as computer-based control of single-cell 
behavior, and synthesis of novel biochemical circuits. The project will 
be developed within team IBIS (ibis.inrialpes.fr) in tight collaboration 
with Grégory Batt from team LIFEWARE at INRIA Paris Rocquencourt. It 
will be focused on the expression in yeast of genes responsive to 
changes of environmental osmolarity via the so-called HOG pathway. Based 
on single-cell gene expression control experiments in microfluidic 
devices developed by LIFEWARE, the following aspects are in the scope of 
the project:

* Development of individual-cell gene expression models accounting for 
intrinsic and/or extrinsic noise;
* Development and application of methods for the identification of the 
above models;
* Investigation of structural network identification from single-cell data;
* Real-time estimation of unobserved gene expression dynamics;
* Participation to design and execution of biological (wetlab) 
single-cell experiments.

Interested candidates should have a solid mathematical background with 
an understanding of dynamical systems, probability and stochastic 
processes, a strong interest in biology and biochemical regulatory 
networks, and practical knowledge of scientific programming tools 
(Matlab and/or C++, or the like).
The successful candidate will be working in a multidisciplinary and 
international environment. Propensity to interaction and cooperation are 
expected qualities of the candidates.

Application deadline is 04/05/2014. Applications must be submitted via 
the official INRIA online system, see 
http://www.inria.fr/institut/recrutement-metiers/offres/theses/campagne-2014 
for the procedure as well as for eligibility, salary, and other information.
More details on this project can be found at the link above (Thesis 
subject n.17) and at http://ibis.inrialpes.fr/article1042.html .

Interested candidates are encouraged to contact Eugenio Cinquemani 
(http://ibis.inrialpes.fr/article941.html) at eugenio.cinquemani@inria.fr
