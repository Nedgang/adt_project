Subject: [bioinfo] PhD position at INRIA Grenoble =?WINDOWS-1252?Q?=96?= DEVELOPMENT OF NOVEL ALGORITHMS FOR STRUCTURE-BASED DRUG DESIGN

PhD position at INRIA Grenoble - Rh=F4ne-Alpes, France

DEVELOPMENT OF NOVEL ALGORITHMS FOR STRUCTURE-BASED DRUG DESIGN

In the context of the INRIA 2014 recruitment campaign, a PhD position in th=
e field of computational drug design is proposed at INRIA Grenoble, France.

The overall subject of the PhD is to extend the state-of-the art methods fo=
r accurate modelling of protein=96drug interactions. The PhD project will b=
e conducted in the NANO-D team, which is funded through national, regional,=
 and a European ERC Starting Grant (http://nano-d.inrialpes.fr). Algorithms=
 developed during the project will be distributed with the SAMSON software =
platform created in the team.
The project consists in several tasks :=20
* development of a reliable potential function for flexible drugs=20
* development of new algorithms to explore the conformational space of flex=
ible drugs=20
* applying motion-planning methods to enhance efficiency of global search a=
lgorithms for protein=96drug docking

Candidates should posses=20
* Strong computer science background
* Strong knowledge of applied math and physics
* Strong oral, written and interpersonal communication skills (working lang=
uage: English =96 knowing French is a plus)
* Good knowledge of C++
* Ability to work independently and with a team

Application deadline is 04/05/2014. Applications must be submitted via the =
official INRIA online system, see http://www.inria.fr/institut/recrutement-=
metiers/offres/theses/campagne-2014 for the procedure as well as for eligib=
ility, salary, and other information.

Detailed project description can be found at=20
