Subject: [bioinfo] Une position de directeur et deux positions de group leader en bioinformatique =?ISO-8859-1?Q?=E0?= l'Institut Pasteur de Paris

THE INSTITUT PASTEUR IS HIRING A DIRECTOR AND 2 SENIOR GROUP LEADERS FOR IT=
S NEW CENTER OF BIOINFORMATICS, BIOSTATISTICS AND INTEGRATIVE BIOLOGY.
=20
Institut Pasteur is a non-profit private foundation dedicated to fundamenta=
l research in human biology and the prevention and treatment of disease, wi=
th a large focus on infectious diseases, through basic science, education, =
and public health activities. The Paris campus houses 146 research units be=
longing to 10 research departments, employing about 2,600 people. It is rec=
ognized worldwide as a leader in infectious disease research and is ranked =
as a top level institution for publication impact in the field of microbiol=
ogy. Institut Pasteur has developed a world-class technological center, its=
 "Technopole" composed of 10 state-of-the-art technological platforms, whic=
h closely collaborate with the researchers and cover their needs for studyi=
ng modern biology from genomic to post-genomic activities, including bioinf=
ormatics, genotyping, DNA and protein sequencing, transcriptomics, proteomi=
cs, protein and antibody production, crystallography and X ray diffraction,=
 macromolecular interactions, collections, animal facilities and an excepti=
onal imaging centre (Imagopole).
=20

THE POSITIONS
=20
The new direction of the Institut Pasteur has defined Bioinformatics/ biost=
atistics and integrative biology as strategic priorities. In this frame, th=
e Pasteur Institute is seeking an outstanding scientist to direct a newly c=
reated =93Centre of Bioinformatics, Biostatistics and Integrative Biology=
=94 located on the Paris campus. The goal of this Center is to federate, fr=
om a computational biology perspective, the different but highly complement=
ary research themes that are present on the Campus: genomics of hosts and p=
athogens, infection biology, evolutionary and population genetics, structur=
al biology and human health. In addition to directing the new Center, the s=
uccessful candidate shall have his/her own research group, in order to purs=
ue his/her scientific interests. To accomplish this double duty, the candid=
ate will receive substantial financial support, both in running costs and p=
ersonnel, from the Pasteur Institute. In this context, the Institut is also=
 opening two additional senior group leader positions in these fields to in=
crease the size of its community and its visibility.
