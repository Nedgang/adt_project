BRAZILIAN SYMPOSIUM ON BIOINFORMATICS 2014
28-30 OCTOBER 2014 BELO HORIZONTE, BRAZIL

             http://www.dcc.ufmg.br/bsb2014

The Brazilian Symposium on Bioinformatics 2014 will take place in Belo 
Horizonte, MG, Brazil, October 28-30, 2014. This year BSB will be 
co-located with the X-meeting and the ISCB Latin America Conference. 
Detailed information about location, program and information about the 
other conferences can be found at: http://www.iscb.org/iscb-latinamerica2014

The Brazilian Symposium on Bioinformatics 2014 is an initiative 
sponsored by the Sociedade Brasileira de Computação, and its special 
interest group in Computational Biology.

BSB provides a general forum for presentation and discussion of original 
research on COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY, BIOINFORMATICS and SYSTEMS BIOLOGY. 
BSB 2014 would like to attract contributions from academic and 
industrial researchers, both in the exact sciences (computer science, 
mathematics and statistics) and in the life sciences (molecular biology, 
biochemistry, genetics, medicine, microbiology and others).

BSB 2014 will accept both full papers (for oral presentation) and short 
papers (to be presented as posters). Proceedings containing accepted 
full papers will be published as a volume in the Lecture Notes in 
Bioinformatics series, from Springer. We will publish extended versions 
of selected papers in a special issue of the BMC Bioinformatics journal, 
a journal with an impact factor of 3.02, and classified as Qualis A by 
Capes.

Topics include (but are not limited to):

    Molecular Sequence Analysis, Motifs, and Pattern Matching
    Biological Databases, Data Management, Data Integration, and Data Mining
    Structural and Functional Genomics
    Comparative Genomics
    Protein Structure and Modeling
    Gene Identification, Regulation and Expression
    Gene Networks
    Molecular Evolution and Phylogenetics
    Computational Systems Biology
    Computational Proteomics
    Statistical Analysis of Molecular Sequences
    Big data applications in Bioinformatics

DATES:

    Submission deadline: Thursday 17 July, 2014.
    Author notification: Thursday 7 August, 2014.
    Final version due: Tuesday 19 August, 2014.
    Workshop: 28-30 October, 2014.
