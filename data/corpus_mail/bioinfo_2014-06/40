This workshop will give insight into the three different worlds of non-coding RNA – transcriptomics – epigenetics – and will highlight known and possible connections among them.
Oral presentations will be selected according to the  quality of the submitted abstracts and AllBio and SeqAhead will offer travel grants to some  young researchers.

Deadline for abstracts submission: 18th June, 2014.
Registration deadline: 23th June, 2014.

A one day tutorial will follow on June 27 on:
