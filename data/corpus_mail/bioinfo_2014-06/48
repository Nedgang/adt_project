WORKSHOP DESCRIPTION


MLSB14, the Eighth International Workshop on Machine Learning in
Systems Biology, is a workshop of the ECCB 2014 conference. It aims to
contribute to the cross-fertilization between the research in machine
learning methods and their applications to systems biology by bringing
together method developers and experimentalists. We are soliciting
submissions bringing forward methods for discovering complex
structures (e.g. interaction networks, molecule structures) and
methods supporting genome-wide data analysis

Please see the workshop website http://www.mlsb.cc for more details.

SUBMISSIONS OF EXTENDED ABSTRACTS

We invite you to submit an extended abstract of up to 4 pages in PDF
