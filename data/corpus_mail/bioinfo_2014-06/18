Subject: [bioinfo] BRAZILIAN SYMPOSIUM ON BIOINFORMATICS 2014

BRAZILIAN SYMPOSIUM ON BIOINFORMATICS 2014
28-30 OCTOBER 2014 RIO DE JANEIRO, BRAZIL

              http://www.dcc.ufmg.br/bsb2014

The Brazilian Symposium on Bioinformatics 2014 will take place in Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil, October 28-30, 2014. This year BSB will be co-located with the X-meeting and the ISCB Latin America Conference. Detailed information about location, program and information about the other conferences can be found at: http://www.iscb.org/iscb-latinamerica2014

The Brazilian Symposium on Bioinformatics 2014 is an initiative sponsored by the Sociedade Brasileira de Computação, and its special interest group in Computational Biology.

BSB provides a general forum for presentation and discussion of original research on COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY, BIOINFORMATICS and SYSTEMS BIOLOGY. BSB 2014 would like to attract contributions from academic and industrial researchers, both in the exact sciences (computer science, mathematics and statistics) and in the life sciences (molecular biology, biochemistry, genetics, medicine, microbiology and others).

BSB 2014 will accept both full papers (for oral presentation) and short papers (to be presented as posters). Proceedings containing accepted full papers will be published as a volume in the Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics series, from Springer. We are negotiating to publish extended versions of selected papers in a special issue of the BMC Bioinformatics journal, a journal with an impact factor of 3.02, and classified as Qualis A by Capes.

Topics include (but are not limited to):

     Molecular Sequence Analysis, Motifs, and Pattern Matching
     Biological Databases, Data Management, Data Integration, and Data Mining
     Structural and Functional Genomics
     Comparative Genomics
     Protein Structure and Modeling
     Gene Identification, Regulation and Expression
     Gene Networks
     Molecular Evolution and Phylogenetics
     Computational Systems Biology
     Computational Proteomics
     Statistical Analysis of Molecular Sequences
     Big data applications in Bioinformatics

DATES:

     Submission deadline: Sunday 22 June, 2014.
     Author notification: Friday 18 July, 2014.
     Final version due: Friday 8 August, 2014.
     Workshop: 28-30 October, 2014.
