Dear Colleagues,

Due to popular demand, we have decided to extend the abstract submission deadline for the 3rd European Symposium of the International Society for Computational Biology Student Council until the 30th of June. We welcome abstracts covering scientific studies as well as novel tools and applications in the fields of computational biology and bioinformatics. As in previous editions, awards will be given to outstanding posters and presentations. All abstracts accepted for oral presentation will be published in a special issue of the BMC Bioinformatics journal.

ESCS2014 is to be held on September 6th 2014 in Strasbourg, France, as a satellite meeting of the European Conference on Computational Biology (ECCB) and will bring together young computational biologists from several research areas and regions of the world. This is your chance to present your work to an international audience of young scientists! In addition, we are proud to host three keynotes from distinguished scientists: Dr. Lennart Martens from the University of Ghent, Dr. Jeroen de Ridder from the Delft University of Technology and Dr. Lars Juhl Jensen from Technical University of Denmark.
