Subject: [bioinfo] Postdoc positions at Inria in Lyon, France

Two postdoc opportunities at Inria in Lyon, France

In the context of a FP7 KBBE European Project, BacHBerry (=93BACterial=20
Hosts for production of Bioactive phenolics from bERRY fruits"), we are=20
seeking two postdoc candidates, each for one year, renewable for up=20
to two years.=20

The candidates will work in the BAMBOO team at the Inria-UCBL in=20
Lyon, France (http://team.inria.fr/bamboo/), in interaction with the
partners of BacHBerry, in particular the CSI team at the IDMEC-IST=20
in Lisbon, Portugal (http://www.idmec.ist.utl.pt/).=20

Both BAMBOO and CSI are methodological teams with an expertise=20
in computational and systems biology.=20

This project aims at tapping the potential of living organisms or systems=
=20
to develop or make natural chemical compounds that are believed to be=20
useful for medicine, agriculture, bioremediation, biodegradation, or etc.=
=20
Most often, the compound is already produced by the organism but in=20
small quantity, and one needs then to manipulate it in order for the=20
production to be increased. Other situations require transplanting part of=
=20
the chemical factory of an organism into another, in general a bacterium,=
=20
for better efficiency. In some cases, the transplant might better be split=
=20
among a community of different bacteria in interaction.

BacHBerry is more specifically interested in the generation of bacterial=20
platforms for sustainable bio-based production of phenolic compounds=20
found in berry fruits. Phenolics are recognised for their antioxydant=20
health-promoting and functional properties, and applied across=20
applications as diverse as aromas, colours, nutraceuticals, and medicines.

More specifically, we are looking for candidates with a PhD in one of=20
the following areas: computer science, mathematics, statistics, computation=
al=20
biology, metabolic engineering, regulation, or related, with a strong taste=
=20
for inter-disciplinary research, and with very good interpersonal skills.=
=20

Ideally, the person will have a long experience with graph algorithms,
discrete combinatorics and/or optimisation techniques.

Unsual CVs are welcome. Knowledge of the portuguese language would=20
also be a plus :-)

Applications should include a motivation letter, a CV, and the address=20
of three references.=20

The applications should be sent to:
Marie-France Sagot, marie-france.sagot@inria.fr
putting also in copy the partner in Lisbon:
Susana Vinga, susanavinga@gmail.com=20=20
ideally before July 31, 2014.=
