Subject: [bioinfo] Computational Models in Biology and Medicine, September 18th/19th, Cologne

Dear colleagues,

we are glad to announce the 2014 GMDS/IBS workshop on

Computational Models in Biology and Medicine

The workshop will take place in Cologne, on September 18th/19th.  The GMDS/=
IBS workshop has established itself as an international forum for researche=
rs from bioinformatics, biostatistics and systems biology, who share a comm=
on interest in the statistical analysis and modeling of biological systems =
and their applications in medical research. The conference is free of charg=
e, and participants are encouraged to contribute posters or talks to one of=
 the topics:

- Cancer Genomics=20
- Transcription Regulation
- Dynamic Modeling
- High Throughput Sequencing

You will find further information on our conference website (http://www.tre=
schgroup.de/GMDS2014cologne.html).

Looking forward to seeing you in Cologne!
