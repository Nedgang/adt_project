Subject: [bioinfo] ICTP workshop on "Interdisciplinary Views on Chromosome Structure and Function" - Last announcement

Dear colleagues & friends,

this is the last announcement about the ICTP workshop on "Interdisciplinary=
 Views on Chromosome Structure and Function" (ICTP-Trieste, Italy, 15-19 Se=
ptember 2014).

The workshop aims at bringing together scientists from a broad range of dis=
ciplines (biologists, physicists, applied mathematicians) in order to cover=
 the most recent findings on the structure & dynamics of prokaryotic and eu=
karyotic chromosomes.

Topics include:
- High-throughput and imaging methods for chromosome structure and dynamics;
- Gene regulatory networks in eukaryotes and bacteria: experiments and mode=
ling;
- Large-scale physical modeling and simulation of chromosome structure;
- System biology of gene expression and regulation.

Participation of PhD students and post-docs is strongly encouraged!

For inscription, please visit:

Please, feel free to spread the announcement amongst whoever you think migh=
