Subject: [bioinfo] CFP: 10th Workshop on Constraint-Based Methods for Bioinformatics,
 Sept 8th 2014, Lyon

CALL FOR PAPERS
------------------------------------------------------------
WCB 2014
10th Workshop on Constraint-Based Methods for Bioinformatics
http://cp2014.a4cp.org/workshops/bioinfo14

Co-located with 20th International Conference on Principles
and Practice of Constraint Programming
http://cp2014.a4cp.org/

September 8 2014, Lyon, France
------------------------------------------------------------

Technical Description
---------------------
During  the last  years, Biology  has become  a source  of challenging
problems for the entire field  of Computer Science in general, and for
the  areas  of  computational  logic  and  constraint  programming  in
particular. Successful approaches to these problems are likely to have
significant  applications  in  several  fields of  research,  such  as
medicine, agriculture, industry,  etc. Several successful applications
of the  Logic and  Constraint Programming paradigms  in Bioinformatics
have been carried  out in the last years, in  the area of phylogenetic
tree  reconstruction, in  haplotype inference,  in  proteins structure
prediction,  in  RNA secondary  structure  prediction,  and in  system
biology, just  to cite  a few. The  workshop aims at  exchanging ideas
between researchers  and collecting, if  possible, new problems  to be
faced in the next future by our community.

Workshop Format
---------------
WCB'14  is  the  10-th  of   a  series  of  consecutive  Workshops  on
Constraint-Based Methods for  Bioinformatics. Previous editions of WCB
were co-located  with various important  international conferences, as
reported below:
- WCB'05: co-located with ICLP-CP 2005 in Sitges
- WCB'06: co-located with CP 2006 in Nantes
- WCB'07: co-located with ICLP 2007 in Porto
- WCB'08: co-located with CPAIOR 2008 in Paris
- WCB'09: co-located with CP 2009 in Lisbon
- WCB'10: co-located with FLOC 2010 in Edinburgh
- WCB'11: co-located with CP 2011 in Perugia
- WCB'12: co-located with ICLP 2012 in Budapest
- WCB'13: co-located with CP 2013 in Uppsala

Details about last-year WCB'13 can be found at
http://cp2013.a4cp.org/workshops/wcb

Paper Submission
----------------
The  topic of  interest are  all those  concerning  bioinformatics and
constraints  and related  (SAT/ASP/Logic  Programming/ILP) techniques,
such as:
- RNA prediction and motif search
- protein structure and functional prediction
- genetic linkage analysis and haplotype inference
- pedigree reconstruction and diagnosis
- genomic selection design
- gene regulatory network inference and analysis
- biochemical network simulation and visualization
- solvers for problems in biology
- metabolic pathway analysis
- DNA sequence assembly
- contig scaffolding
- multiple sequence alignment
- machine learning and big data
- ontologies
- constraint databases
- logical interfaces to relational databases
- web services
- databases integration and federation
- RDF graphs and tools
  
Submitted papers can be:
- Full papers describing new research results
- Extended Abstracts concerning original (unpublished) results.
- Abstracts describing ongoing work.
- System descriptions (with demos at the workshop).
- Summaries of already accepted or recently published papers/results.
- Well-motivated proposals of bioinformatics problems for constraint
   based methods.

Submitted papers should be 3-15 page papers in LNCS format.

Submissions are managed through EasyChair
https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wcb14

At least one author of each accepted paper must attend the workshop.
Please note that every workshop participant needs to be registered for
the workshop.
