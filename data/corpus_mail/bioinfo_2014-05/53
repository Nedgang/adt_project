PhD position: Development of Computational Protein Design Tools

We are looking for a highly motivated candidate for a three year PhD to 
work at the intersection of Discrete Optimization and Computational 
Structural Biology, on models and algorithms for Computation Protein 
Design (CPD). CPD's aim is to rationally design and optimize proteins in 
order to define, enhance, or modify the properties of enzymes to create 
new bio-catalysts. These may have important uses in the synthesis of 
other valuable molecules (food, drugs, cosmetics...) or as crucial 
actors in renewable bio-energy processes. As proteins, these enzymes are 
also eco-friendly (degradable, usable at ambient pression/temperature).

Various algorithms and models have already been defined to optimize 
protein designs, with different targets but all are faced with the huge 
discrete space defined by protein sequences and their 3D structures, 
defining NP-hard problems. The work will take place in an ongoing 
project involving a team of structural biologists specialized in 
molecular modeling from LISBP (INRA, CNRS, Toulouse) and computer 
scientists specialized in discrete optimization from INRA, Toulouse. 
Together, we have recently shown that recent discrete exact optimization 
techniques introduced to solve Weighted Constraint Satisfaction problems 
(or Cost Function Networks) could speed-up existing exact approaches to 
CPD by several orders of magnitude [1,2]. The aim of the PhD will be to 
bring these improvements to a new level by tackling more complex protein 
design models, incorporating local or global backbone flexibility as 
well as side-chain flexibility, possibly with new criteria mixing 
stability and affinity, positive and negative design targets, with an 
ultimate practical goal of producing an ensemble of sequences to test 
for activity. A computing cluster with thousands of cores can be 
accessed at INRA Toulouse.

Duties and eligibility: Motivated candidates with an academic degree at 
the Masters level in either

- Computer Science/Discrete optimization with a strong taste for 
applications in Biology are invited to apply for this position or

- Structural Bioinformatics/Molecular Modeling of proteins with a strong 
taste for algorithms, programming and mathematics.

A strong interest in both Computer Science and Structural Bioinformatics 
is absolutely required. Because of the interdisciplinary nature of the 
project, candidates will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis and 
interested candidates with a background in bioinformatics with an 
emphasis in algorithms will also be considered. The work will include 
algorithm design, implementation and testing on actual protein designs, 
protein flexibility modeling as well as preparation of protein designs 
by different methods and writing of research papers. Excellent 
programming skills, ideally in efficient compiled languages such as 
C/C++, will be extremely beneficial. A good knowledge of spoken and 
written English is a highly valuable asset. A good knowledge of spoken 
French is also appreciated. If needed, training can be provided.

A PhD grant is provided for 3 years, at a current level of 1,757€/month 
(gross salary). Applications should include a CV, a brief description of 
research interests and past research experience, copies of 
exam-certificates and grades, a copy of your Master’s thesis (or a 
summary) and a cover letter motivating why you are interested in the 
position. The candidates are encouraged to provide contact information 
of at most two reference persons. The evaluation of candidates will 
begin on June 20, 2014 and will continue until the position is filled.
