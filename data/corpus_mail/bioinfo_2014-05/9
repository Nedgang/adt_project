Subject: [bioinfo] BioNetVisA workshop at ECCB2014: from biological network to data
 analysis in biology and medicine


                                             BioNetVisA workshop at ECCB2014
 From biological network reconstruction to data visualization and 
analysis in molecular biology and medicine.

The workshop will take place in Strasbourg, France, on September 7th, 
2014 as part of the European Conference on Computational Biology ECCB’14
The abstracts submission for talks and posters is open
https://sysbio.curie.fr/bionetvisa
http://www.eccb14.org/program/workshops/bionetvisa


A travel fellowship for funding participation of young researchers will 
be available. Priority will be given to selected speakers.
Scope:
One day workshop, BioNetVisA will be focused on computational pathway 
analysis, applications in research, clinics, biotech and beyond.
The goal of BioNetVisA workshop is to build a discussion around:
- Approaches for biological knowledge formalisation, data integration 
and analysis.
- Compatibility between different methods and biological networks 
resources available in the field.
- Applicability for concrete research and clinical projects based on 
high-throughput data.
- Accessibility of available tools for wide range of user in every-day 
standalone application in biological, clinical and biotech labs.
The workshop is suitable for wide audience as database providers, 
networks creators, computational and experimental biologists, clinicians 
and anyone who is interested to be exposed to the different paradigms of 
network biology and the latest achievements in the field.

Please spread the word and forward this advertisement to your colleagues.
