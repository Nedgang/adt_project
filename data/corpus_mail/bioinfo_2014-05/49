 Bioinformatics and Bioengineering

[We apologize if you receive multiple copies of this email]

Special Session on Optimization Methods in Bioinformatics and Bioengineerin=
g (OMBB)
2014 IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence (IEEE SSCI 2014)
December 9-12, 2014, Orlando, Florida, USA
http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~ucberal/SS-OMBB-IEEE_SSCI_2014.html

Submission deadline: 15 June 2014
Submission site: http://ieee-cis.org/conferences/ssci2014/upload.php


Aim and Scope

Bioinformatics and Bioengineering (BB) are interdisciplinary scientific fie=
lds involving many branches of computer science, engineering, mathematics, =
and statistics. Bioinformatics is concerned with the development and applic=
ation of computational methods for the modelling, retrieving and analysis o=
f biological data, whilst Bioengineering is the application of engineering =
techniques to biology so as to create usable and economically viable produc=
ts.

Bioinformatics and Bioengineering are relatively new fields in which Chilen=
ges and issues can often be formulated as optimization problems subject to =
multiple conflicting objectives. Such multiobjective optimization problems =
span from traditional problems, such as the optimization of biochemical pro=
cesses, protein structure alignment and prediction, to more modern problems=
, such as directed evolution, drug design, experimental design, and optimiz=
ation of manufacturing processes, material and equipment.

The main aim of this special session, which is organized within the SSCI-MC=
DM'14 Symposium, is to bring together both experts and new-comers working o=
n Optimization Methods in Bioinformatics and Bioengineering (OMBB) to discu=
ss new and exciting issues in this area.


Topics of Interest

We encourage submission of papers describing new concepts, strategies and c=
hallenges in the area of Bioinformatics and Bioengineering (BB). In additio=
n, we are interested in application papers discussing the power and applica=
bility of these novel methods to real-world problems in BB. You are invited=
 to submit papers that are unpublished original work for this special sessi=
on at SSCI-MCDM'14.

The topics are, but not limited to, the following

* Optimization methods for BB problems
* Novel optimization problems in BB
* Emerging non-standard problem challenges in BB problems (e.g. missing obj=
ective values, resourcing issues, dynamic changes, many objectives, large-s=
cale, mixed-typed variables, etc.)
* Closed-loop optimization in BB
* Interactive multiobjective optimization in BB
* Predictive fitness landscape design for BB problems
* Integrating user preferences into multiobjective optimization of BB probl=
ems
* Handling practicalities in BB problems, such as uncertainty, noise, const=
raints, fixed budget of evaluations, high computational costs, etc.
* Robustness in the optimization of BB problems
* Visualization techniques for complex BB problems
* Adaptation, learning, and anticipation in BB problems


Submission Instructions

We welcome original contributions describing ongoing projects or completed =
work.
