Subject: [bioinfo] SIB joint course with the Doctoral Program StarOmics : "Next Generation
 Comparative Phylogenomics", 2-6 June 2014

Dear all,

We are pleased to announce the following course from the Doctoral 
Program StarOmics and organized by the SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics

" Next Generation Comparative Phylogenomics".

This four-day course will be held in Geneva during the week of 2-6 June 
2014. It will focus on the species classification, which is based on 
synapomorphies observed in comparative life science studies, including 
morphology, anatomy, cell biology, developmental biology. In this 
course, evolutionary concepts and biological findings will be linked to 
associated alterations at the molecular level. Course days will be an 
alternance of lectures and practicals.
An extra day will be dedicated to a mini-symposium, where international 
experts will present studies on improving the quality of large-scale 
analysis and application of comparative phylogenomics.

Further information and application form are available from: 
http://edu.isb-sib.ch/course/view.php?id=156.
Please note few seats are still available.

For administrative questions, please contact staromics@cuso.ch
For technical and scientific questions, please contact training@isb-sib.ch

Hope to see you there!

For the organizers,
Diana Marek
