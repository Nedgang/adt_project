Subject: [bioinfo] "NGS and non-coding RNA data analysis" workshop

Dear all,

The registration for this COST WS is now opened.

We are happy to announce the upcoming "NGS and non-coding RNA data analysis" workshop II (2014) 15-16 May, Plovdiv, Bulgaria

The SeqAhead COST action BM1006 is organising a 2 day workshop with presentations on non-coding RNA (ncRNA) research, bioinformatics, data analysis and stimulate discussions between biologists and bioinformaticians. 

The Workshop will concentrate on current topics in NGS and non-coding RNAs, with special emphasis on data analysis. The ultimate goal of the workshop is to bring closer software developers, bioinformaticians and experimental scientists, bridging the gap between users' needs and developers' goals.

Workshop Target:

-biologists with research in ncRNA (ncRNA, small RNAs, miRNAs) applying or planning to apply Next Generation Sequencing technologies
-bioinformaticians involved in data analysis or developing algorithms for data analysis of ncRNA data.

The workshop is open for everybody in the ncRNA and NGS field. The workshop is free of charge and participants have to pay their own hotel and travel. COST will offer travel reimbursement to some selected researchers and you will need to provide a poster abstract.
