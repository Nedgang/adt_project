Subject: [bioinfo] Postdoc in Bacterial Transcriptomics, Station biologique, Roscoff

*Job description*

A two year postdoc position is available in the /Marine Phototrophic 
Prokaryotes/ team to study the impact of the variation of various 
environmental factors on the marine picocyanobacteria /Synechococcus/. 
This genus is among the most pertinent biological models to tackle this 
question since it is ecologically relevant and ubiquitous. Furthermore, 
numerous genome sequences (41 /Synechococcus/, 3 /Cyanobium/) and 
strains in culture representative of most ecotypes identified in the 
field are now available, which allow them to be studied at all levels of 
organization from genes to the global ocean.

In the framework of the ANR project SAMOSA (2014-2018), we plan to 
develop a system biology approach to characterize and model the main 
acclimation (/i.e./, physiological) and adaptation (/i.e./, 
evolutionary) mechanisms involved in the differential responses of 
/Synechococcus/ clades/ecotypes to environmental fluctuations, with the 
goal to better predict their respective adaptability, and hence dynamics 
and distribution in the field in the context of global change. The 
selected candidate will participate in the experiment setup, the culture 
harvesting and the preparation of RNA samples as well as in the 
bioinformatic analyses of transcriptomic data obtained by RNA-Seq 
technologies. Physiological experiments will consist in submitting 
strains representative of the dominant ecotypes to various environmental 
stresses (e.g., high light, UV, temperature) under continuous light or 
light-dark cycle conditions. The postdoctoral fellow could also be 
involved in i) the further characterization of genes identified by 
transcriptomics and/or comparative genomics as being involved in the 
stress adaptation of /Synechococcus/ ecotypes, using mutagenesis and ii) 
studying their distribution/expression in metagenomes and 
metatranscriptomes from various oceanic regions and depths showing 
contrasted environmental parameters, available from the TARA-Oceans cruise.


*Required qualifications*

The candidate should have experience in bioinformatics applied to DNA or 
RNA sequence analysis (comparative genomics, metagenome analysis, 
phylogeny, microbial diversity and evolution) and/or bacterial 
transcriptomics (RNA extraction, real time PCR, RNA-Seq library 
preparation).


*Terms of employment*

/Host lab:/The postdoc will be based in the Marine Phototrophic 
Prokaryote (MaPP) team at the Station Biologique de Roscoff 
(http://www.sb-roscoff.fr/en-ppm.html)
/Beginning of the post doc/: sept 2014; 24 months
/Salary : /about 1900-2000 euros/months

*The application should be written in French or English and include a 
letter explaining the competences and scientific motivation, a CV, a 
publication list as well as recommendation letters from previous 
supervisors. All documents should be sent by email to Laurence 
Garczarek: laurence.garczarek@sb-roscoff.fr. *
