                    Prague Stringology Conference 2014

                19th event of the Prague Stringology Club

                       http://www.stringology.org

                            Call for Papers

               Prague, Czech Republic, September 1-3, 2014

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

* New: indexed by Scopus and Thomson Reuters

PSC 2014 is the 19th event of the Prague Stringology Club. It is an
international conference focusing on stringology and related areas. It
is organized annually by the Prague Stringology Club, a research group
in the Department of Theoretical Computer Science at the Faculty of
Information Technology of Czech Technical University in Prague. The
proceedings of recent conferences are indexed in Thomson Reuters,
Scopus and DBLP.



TOPICS:

Stringology is a part of algorithmic research that deals with the
processing of text strings. It has existed for at least thirty years
and developed into a respected subfield of its own. The last twenty
years have produced an explosion of new results. This progress is due
in part to the human genome effort, an area to which string algorithms
make important contributions. String processing extends into tree
processing that is called Arbology. The topics of the conference
include but are not limited to:

   * algorithms for pattern matching in strings, images and trees
   * data structures (automata, trees etc.) for pattern matching
     in strings, images and trees
   * coding and data compression
   * bioinformatics
   * information retrieval
   * string processing algorithms in databases
   * searching for regularities
   * natural language processing



INVITED TALK:

   * To be announced



SUBMISSION:

Authors are cordially invited to submit their full papers (PDF format,
up to 15 pages, A4 page format) by May 13, 2014. The paper should start
with the title, each author's name, affiliation, and e-mail address,
and a one-paragraph summary of the results and ideas. The paper should
be submitted via submission server
(https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=psc20140).

For their final version the papers are required to be prepared using
the LaTeX style available athttp://www.stringology.org/pscproc2
which has an interface compatible to the standard LNCS style.

HISTORY:

PSC 2014 was preceded by Prague Stringology Workshops in 1996-2000 and
by Prague Stringology Conferences in 2001-2006, 2008-2013. Each year
proceedings are prepared for the conference. They are published by
Czech Technical University in Prague and are also available from the
PSC web pages. Selected papers from the later workshops were also
published in a special issue of the journal Kybernetika. Selected
papers from the 2002-2006, 2008 conferences were then published in the
Nordic Journal of Computing, Journal of Automata, Languages, and
Combinatorics, International Journal of Foundations in Computer
Science, and Discrete Applied Mathematics.



LOCATION & PUBLICATION:

PSC 2014 will be held at the Department of Theoretical Computer Science
the Czech Technical University in Prague on September 1-3, 2014.
(The precise location will be announced later.) The working
language is English. As usual, accepted papers will appear in
conference proceedings published by the Czech Technical University in
Prague and distributed at the conference. After further refereeing,
selected papers will then be published in an international journal.
