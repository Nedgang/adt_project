Subject: [bioinfo] competitive call for postdoctoral fellows

Dear all,

The Faculty of Natural Sciences and Technology at NTNU has set up the FINS =
initiative to support excellent junior scientists from outside Norway who p=
lan to submit applications for independent research fellowships (such as Ma=
rie Slodowska Curie (MSC) Individual Fellowships, etc.) in order to pursue =
an academic research career. I am inviting PhDs in semantic web technologie=
s who would like to do postdoctoral work in Norway to apply. More informati=
on can be found on: http://www.ntnu.edu/nt/research/fins and on http://www.=
ntnu.edu/nt/research/fins/biology/kuiper-lab. It would be great if you coul=
d forward this to potentially interested parties.=20

Best regards,
Martin Kuiper
