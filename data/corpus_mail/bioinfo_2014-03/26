Subject: [bioinfo] Researcher Position in Bioinformatics for Translational Research 

Researcher Position in Bioinformatics for Translational Research at CNRS-EI=
SBM, Lyon, in relation to the IMI-eTRIKS Consortium.

**
KEYWORDS: Computational Systems Biology, Pathways and Networks, Data Integr=
ation and Modelling, Machine Learning

A Researcher position is available as part of the eTRIKS (European Translat=
ional Research Information and Knowledge Management Services) project, fund=
ed by the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) of the European Commission =
7th Framework Programme and the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Indus=
tries and Associations: http://www.imi.europa.eu/

**
SCIENTIFIC PROJECT: The eTRIKS Consortium is dedicated to delivering Europe=
an Translational Information and Knowledge Management Services initially fo=
r all IMI projects, then for other European translational research projects=
.=20
These projects encompass translational bioinformatics, clinical research in=
formatics, health/clinical informatics and the development of new analytica=
l tools. They use tranSMART as part of the software knowledge management pl=
atform: http://www.etriks.org; http://www.transmartproject.org

**
JOB CONTEXT: High throughput experimental methods are generating large amou=
nts of heterogenous data associated with patient populations. This data inc=
ludes multiple =91omics data such as transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolom=
ics and genome structural variations. The integration of these data with cl=
inical data relating to disease progression and outcome has the potential t=
o impact on strategies for personalised medicine.=20

**
JOB DESCRIPTION: The successful applicant will work on data analytics and w=
ill evaluate existing, and develop new approaches for the integration of cl=
inical data with multiple types of high dimensional =91omics data. The appr=
oaches for integration will be used for biomarker discovery and the identif=
ciation of new disease subtypes in a large portfolio of IMI and non-IMI pro=
jects. She/he will contribute to enhancement of the underlying tranSMART sy=
stem with required analytical functions and workflows for the analysis and =
integration of clinical and =91omics data.
The selected candidate will be based in Lyon-Gerland within the CNRS-EISBM =
team led by Charles Auffray, hosted by Claude Bernard University on the Cha=
rles M=E9rieux campus: http://www.eisbm.org; http://workshop.eisbm.eu


**
REQUIRED EXPERIENCE/SKILLS: Candidates should have a PhD degree in computer=
 science, mathematics, physics, bioinformatics or engineering. Good program=
ming skills in either Python, Matlab, C/C++, R or similar are essential, as=
 is a strong mathematical background. Experience of analysis of biological =
networks and machine learning is desirable. The position requires good comm=
unication skills in English and involves working in collaboration with eTRI=
KS partners on translational medicine projects across Europe.

**
CONTRACT DURATION: Available immediately for two years with possible one-ye=
ar extension.

**
SALARY: Depending on qualifications and experience, based on CNRS salary gr=
id.

APPLICATION: Send CV, cover letter and names of two references to Charles A=
uffray
