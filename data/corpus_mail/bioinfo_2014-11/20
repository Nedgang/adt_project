2nd INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ALGORITHMS FOR COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY

AlCoB 2015

Mexico City, Mexico

August 4-6, 2015

Organized by:

Centre for Complexity Sciences (C3)
School of Sciences
Institute for Research in Applied Mathematics and Systems (IIMAS)
Graduate Program in Computing Science and Engineering
National Autonomous University of Mexico

Research Group on Mathematical Linguistics (GRLMC)
Rovira i Virgili University

AIMS:

AlCoB aims at promoting and displaying excellent research using string and
graph algorithms and combinatorial optimization to deal with problems in
biological sequence analysis, genome rearrangement, evolutionary trees, and
structure prediction.

The conference will address several of the current challenges in
computational biology by investigating algorithms aimed at: 1) assembling
sequence reads into a complete genome, 2) identifying gene structures in the
genome, 3) recognizing regulatory motifs, 4) aligning nucleotides and
comparing genomes, 5) reconstructing regulatory networks of genes, and 6)
inferring the evolutionary phylogeny of species.

Particular focus will be put on methodology and significant room will be
reserved to young scholars at the beginning of their career.

VENUE:

AlCoB 2015 will take place in Mexico City, the oldest capital city in the
Americas and the largest Spanish-speaking city in the world. The venue will
be the main campus of the National Autonomous University of Mexico.

SCOPE:

Topics of either theoretical or applied interest include, but are not
limited to:

Exact sequence analysis
Approximate sequence analysis
Pairwise sequence alignment
Multiple sequence alignment
Sequence assembly
Genome rearrangement
Regulatory motif finding
Phylogeny reconstruction
Phylogeny comparison
Structure prediction
Compressive genomics
Proteomics: molecular pathways, interaction networks ...
Transcriptomics: splicing variants, isoform inference and quantification,
differential analysis =85
Next-generation sequencing: population genomics, metagenomics,
metatranscriptomics ...
Microbiome analysis
Systems biology

STRUCTURE:

AlCoB 2015 will consist of:

invited talks
invited tutorials
peer-reviewed contributions

INVITED SPEAKERS:

to be announced
