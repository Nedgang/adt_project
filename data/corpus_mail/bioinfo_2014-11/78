Subject: [bioinfo] PostDoc position, Prof. Theis, Institute of Computational Biology, Munich

Dear all,

message from Fabian Theis:

We are looking for a PostDoc Bioinformatics and/or Biostatistics - =94Machi=
ne learning in high-dimensional biological data sets=94 2014/2585.

The position is located at the Institute of Computational Biology (Prof. Fa=
bian Theis), a leading research group in the field of bioinformatics and sy=
stems biology. The project will be an interdisciplinary effort with theoret=
ical and computational approaches applied to molecular data from local and =
international collaboration partners.

Job Description

In the project we will develop methods for the statistical analysis and vis=
ualization of single-cell transcriptomics profiles. Hereby we will extend e=
xisting latent variable models in order to account for confounding effects.=
 In a second step, these results will be used to model cellular decisions b=
ased on observed, possibly time-resolved, population distributions. We will=
 apply this to data of differentiating cells in order to gain further insig=
hts into stem cell differentiation processes.

Your Qualifications

Applicants should have a PhD in bioinformatics, bio- statistics, mathematic=
s, physics, computer sciences or a related discipline and experience in mac=
hine learning, statistical analyses and programming. Moreover, appli- cants=
 should bring a profound affinity to the biological interpretation of achie=
ved results and be comfortable at interacting with colleagues in an interdi=
sciplinary setting.

Our Offer
* Working in an innovative, well-equipped and scientifically stimulating su=
rrounding
* Further training opportunities
* Initial short-term employment contract for three years with a standard pu=
blic service salary (TV EntgO Bund EG 13)
* Moreover, you will be associated to the Department of Mathematics and Bio=
informatics and the Life Science faculty of the Technical University Munich.

The Helmholtz Zentrum M=FCnchen as holder of the Bavarian Advancement of Wo=
men Prize and of the Total E-Quality Certificate is striving to increase th=
e overall proportion of women on its staff and thus expressly urges qualifi=
ed women to apply.

We are looking forward to receiving your comprehensive online application (=
cover letter, CV in English, PhD thesis and relevant publications, recommen=
dation letters or con- tact information of professional references).
