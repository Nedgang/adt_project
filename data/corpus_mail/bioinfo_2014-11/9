Subject: [bioinfo] DebianMed annual sprint in Saint Malo 31/01/15 -> 01/02/15

DebianMed [0] is a team of Debian, the Linux distribution, focusing on
open source software packaging related to life sciences (medical,
biology, bioinformatics, ..). Ubuntu is a derivative of Debian, and
packages in Debian are available in Ubuntu distributions.

Debian already provides tons of bioinformatics (and other) packages, and
our goal is to provide more and more software, to ease the installation,
availability and use of those software for the final user.

We hold this year our annual sprint in Saint Malo, France, from 31/01/15
to 01/02/15. Our sprints are a way to collaborate on software packaging
and Debian future.

We welcome newcomers willing to learn Debian packaging and/or willing to
package their bioinformatics software (open source ) to make them
available in Debian/Ubuntu repositories. Debian developers can help you
during this week-end to prepare your package (help you, not do it for
you...). Please note that your software should be open source to be
eligible.

This is an informal meeting, not a conference/workshop/..., and it is
free. Room space is limited, so if you are interested, please let us know.
