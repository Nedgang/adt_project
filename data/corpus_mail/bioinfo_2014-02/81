----------Abstract:

In this thesis, we address the problem of identifying and quantifying
variants (alternative splicing and genomic polymorphism) in RNA-seq
data when no reference genome is available, without assembling the
full transcripts. Based on the fundamental idea that each variant
corresponds to a recognizable pattern, a bubble, in a de Bruijn graph
constructed from the RNA-seq reads, we propose a general model for all
variants in such graphs. We then introduce an exact method, called
KisSplice, to extract alternative splicing events. Finally, we show
that it enables to identify more correct events than general purpose
transcriptome assemblers (Grabherr et al. (2011)).

In order to deal with ever-increasing volumes of NGS data, we put an
extra effort to make our method as scalable as possible. The main time
bottleneck in the KisSplice is the bubble enumeration step. Thus, in
order to improve the running time of KisSplice, we propose a new
algorithm to enumerate bubbles. We show both theoretically and
experimentally that our algorithm is several orders of magnitude
faster than the heuristics based on cycle enumeration. The main memory
bottleneck in KisSplice is the construction and representation of the
de Bruijn graph. Thus, in order to reduce the memory consumption of
KisSplice, we propose a new compact way to build and represent a de
Bruijn graph improving over the state of the art (Chikhi and Rizk
(2012)). We show both theoretically and experimentally that our
approach uses 30% to 40% less memory than such state of the art, with
an insignificant impact on the construction time.

Additionally, we show that the same techniques used to list bubbles
can be applied in two classical enumeration problems: cycle listing
and the K-shortest paths problem. In the first case, we give the first
optimal algorithm to list cycles in undirected graphs, improving over
Johnson's algorithm, the long-standing state of the art. This is the
first improvement to this problem in almost 40 years. We also give the
first optimal algorithm to list st-paths in undirected graphs. In the
second case, we consider a different parameterization of the classical
K-shortest simple (loopless) paths problem: instead of bounding the
number of st-paths, we bound the weight of the st-paths. We present
new algorithms with the same time complexities but using
exponentially less memory than previous approaches.
