The rapidly expanding field of biology creates enormous challenges for computational visualization techniques for enabling researchers to gain insight from their large and highly complex data sets.

The Symposium on Biological Data Visualization (BioVis) is the premier international and interdisciplinary event for all aspects of visualization in biology. The symposium brings together researchers from the visualization, bioinformatics, and biology communities with the purpose of educating, inspiring, and engaging visualization researchers in problems in biological data visualization as well as bioinformatics and biology researchers in state-of-the-art visualization research.

We are looking for contributions on all aspects of visualization in biology, from molecular to cell, tissue, organism and population biology. Suggested topics include, but are not limited to:
	* Genome and sequence data, including genomic variation data
	* Multivariate omics data (transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, etc.)
	* Phylogenetic data
	* Biological networks and pathways
	* Biological Ontologies
	* Structures (e.g., protein or RNA structures)
	* Visualization of biological image data, such as microscopy data
	* Integration of image and omics data for systems biology
	* Modeling, simulation, and visualization of biological systems
	* Visualization in neurobiology and developmental biology
	* Systems and software frameworks for biological visualization
	* Integration of visualization in biological workflows or collaborative processes
	* Visualization and visual analytics of integrated biological data sets
	* Usability of visualization by biologists
	* Creation and visualization of biological atlases and metadata
	* Processes for interdisciplinary collaboration between biology and visualization.
