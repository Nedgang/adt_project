Subject: [bioinfo] Cybergenetics: real-time feedback control of living cells - Mustafa
 Khammash (ETHZ) - March 7 - Paris

Dear all,

Mustafa Khammash (Biosystems Science and Engineering Dept at ETH Zurich)=20
will give a seminar entitled "Cybergenetics: real-time feedback control=20
of living cells" on Friday, March 7 at 11am in the seminar room of the=20
Mati=E8re et Syst=E8mes Complexes lab (Condorcet Building, Paris Diderot=20
University).

The abstract and a short bio is enclosed below. Note that his talk will=20
be followed by my HDR defense (2pm).

Best regards,
Gregory

Abstract:
Wiener envisioned a science where the study of control and communication in=
 man and the machine can be unified. His Cybernetics, or the art of steerin=
g, embodied this ambitious vision. Wiener's ideas predated the discovery of=
 DNA and the subsequent biology revolution, and his cybernetic examples wer=
e inevitably limited to known physiological control systems at the scale of=
 the organism. Today, the confluence of modern genetic manipulation techniq=
ues, powerful experimental measurement technologies, and advanced analysis =
and computational methodologies is making it possible to achieve real-time =
feedback control of living cells at the gene level. We refer to this nascen=
t area of research Cybergenetics.  This presentation will describe novel an=
alytical and experimental work that demonstrates how de novo control system=
s  can be interfaced with living cells and used to control their behaviour.=
 We will draw comparisons with endogenous feedback control systems in biolo=
gy as well as with engineered control systems in technology.


Short Bio:
Mustafa Khammash is the Professor of Control Theory and Systems Biology at =
the Department of Biosystems Science and Engineering (D-BSSE) at the Swiss =
Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich (ETH).  He received his PhD in co=
ntrol theory at Rice University, Houston in 1990. From 1990 till 2001, he w=
as on the faculty of Electrical Engineering at Iowa State University, Ames,=
 Iowa. In 2001 he joined the Mechanical Engineering Department at the Unive=
rsity of California at Santa Barbara (UCSB) where he served as the Director=
 of the Center for Control, Dynamical systems, and Computations (CCDC) from=
 2006 till he joined ETH in 2011.
Working at the interface of systems biology, synthetic biology, and control=
 theory, Khammash develops novel computational methods for the modeling, si=
mulation, analysis, and control of biological networks. In the area of syst=
ems biology, he utilizes these methods for reverse engineering biological c=
omplexity, with particular interest in understanding the role of dynamics, =
feedback, and randomness in endogenous biological circuits. In the area of =
synthetic biology, his research focuses on creating the mathematical founda=
tion and necessary tools for the robust control of living cells.
Khammash is a Fellow of the IEEE, IFAC, and the Japan Society for the Promo=
tion of Science (JSPS). He is the recipient of the National Science Foundat=
ion Young Investigator Award, the Iowa State University Foundation Early Ac=
hievement in Research and Scholarship Award, the ISU College of Engineering=
 Young Faculty Research Award, and the Ralph Budd Best Engineering PhD Thes=
is Award.
