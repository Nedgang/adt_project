Subject: [bioinfo] Mathematical and Computational Evolutionary Biology, 15-19 June 2014,
 Montpellier

*MCEB - Mathematical and Computational Evolutionary Biology, *
15-19 June 2014 - South of France

/Webpage:/ http://www.lirmm.fr/mceb2014/

Pre-registration deadline: February 28

/Scope:/ Mathematical and computational tools and concepts form an
essential basis for modern evolutionary studies. The goal of the MCEB
conference (at its 6th edition) is to bring together scientists with
diverse backgrounds to present recent advances and discuss open problems 
  in the field of mathematical and computational evolutionary biology.
This year a special focus will be given to the applications to 
biodiversity in all its aspects: from its conservation to its ecology
and evolution; from the diversity within a genome, to that between
individuals within a species and that between species in an ecosystem.
General concepts, models, methods and algorithms will also be presented
and discussed, just as during the previous conference editions.

/Where and when:/ Hameau de l'Etoile (http://www.hameaudeletoile.com/)
in the Montpellier region, South of France, 15-19 June 2014.

/Cost:/ Conference fees including accommodation (4 nights), meals,
coffee breaks, buses, etc., will be between 350 - 500 EUR, and will vary 
depending on the room  type. PhD students and postdocs will benefit of 
the cheapest rooms.


/Keynote speakers:/
Richard Durbin (Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, UK): Population genomics
Daniel Huson (University of Tubingen, DE): Environmental metagenomics
Nicolas Lartillot (Université de Montréal, CA): Comparative genomics and 
ecology
Arne Mooers (Simon Fraser University, CA): Considering the Tree of Life
in Conservation
Hélène Morlon (Centre de Mathématiques Appliquées, FR): Dynamics of
biodiversity
Rasmus Nielsen (University of Berkeley, US): Theory and methods
developments in Population Genetics
Adam Siepel (Cornell University, US): Genome-wide inference of ancestral 
recombination graphs
Mike Steel (University of Canterbury, NZ): What can we reconstruct from
the past?
