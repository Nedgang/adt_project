Subject: [bioinfo] [Stage] Proposition de 2 stages Master II - Java Programming

Bonjour,=20

Vous trouverez ci-dessous 2 sujets de stage propos=C3=A9s dans le cadre du =
projet eTRIKS (European Translational Research Information and Knowledge Ma=
nagement Services : http://www.etriks.org/) =C3=A0 l'EISBM.

Internship 1:
6-month Java Programming Internship: France & Luxembourg
Employer: CNRS
Website: http://www.eisbm.org/
Location: CNRS-EISBM, Lyon, France & LCSB, Luxembourg
Expires: 15/12/2014
Internship allowance: =E2=82=AC 436.00 per month
Qualifications: Undergraduate - Bachelor's degree
Employment type: Temporary
Job hours: Full-time
Duration: 6 months
Starting date: Beginning of 2015
Key words: Programming, Java, graphical languages, network representation, =
Systems Biology

An internship position is available as part of the eTRIKS (European Transla=
tional Research Information and Knowledge Management Services) project, fun=
ded by the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) of the European Commission=
 7th Framework Programme and the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Indu=
stries and Associations.

The selected candidate will be based in Lyon-Gerland within the CNRS-EISBM =
team led by Charles Auffray, hosted by Claude Bernard University on the Cha=
rles M=C3=A9rieux campus. For approximately 2 months the intern will be wor=
king in Luxembourg with our collaborators at the Luxembourg Center for Syst=
ems Biomedicine.

The goal of this project is to develop a translator from Systems Biology Gr=
aphical Notation standard (file exported from CellDesigner software) into t=
he LCSB MapViewer environment (Java). The translator will be developed in c=
ollaboration with LCSB Java programming experts. Prior knowledge in Systems=
 Biology domain is not necessary.

This is an excellent opportunity to get introduced into Systems Biology are=
a and participate in a highly collaborative translational medicine project.

Required Skills: Proficiency in Java programming and good communication ski=
lls in English.

Recommended Skills: Knowledge of SQL and PostgreSQL would be helpful.

Enthusiastic and motivated candidates are encouraged to contact Prof. Charl=
es Auffray jobs@eisbm.org  with a CV and a brief description of their progr=
amming skills.

An internship position is available as part of the eTRIKS (European Transla=
tional Research Information and Knowledge Management Services) project, fun=
ded by the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) of the European Commission=

The selected candidate will be based in Lyon-Gerland within the CNRS-EISBM =
team led by Charles Auffray, hosted by Claude Bernard University on the Cha=
rles M=C3=A9rieux campus.

The goal of the project is to develop a code in Java for translating a grap=
hical model in Systems Biology Graphical Notation (SBGN, www.sbgn.org) into=
 the Neo4j Graph Database representation. Systems Biology Graphical Notatio=
n standard (SBGN-ML file format) is used for unambiguous biological network=
 representation. Transformation into the graph database environment will al=
low easier access to various data, graph database querying and network anal=
ysis.
This position allows an intern to participate in a state-of-the-art EU syst=
ems biomedicine project.

Required Skills: Proficiency in Java programming, good communication skills=
 in English.

Enthusiastic and motivated candidates are encouraged to contact Prof. Charl=
es Auffray jobs@eisbm.org  with a CV and a brief description of their progr=
