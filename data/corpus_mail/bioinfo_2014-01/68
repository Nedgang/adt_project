A young investigator position open at the Institute for Computational 
Biology (IBC) of Montpellier (France)

We plan to hire a young investigator, typically with a PhD plus some 
post-doc experience, a good level of publishing, communication 
abilities, and a taste for multidisciplinary research.  Our project aims 
at the development and integration of bioinformatics tools for an 
interdisciplinary project dealing with structural and/or functional 
annotations of pathogen proteomes.

We are seeking a high level computer scientist with strong experience in 
bioinformatics and solid programming skills; knowledge in 3D protein 
structures and/or statistical learning would be a plus.

The successful candidate will have good knowledge in one or several of 
the following topics: statistical learning, hidden Markov models, 
pattern matching, 3D and geometry algorithmics, protein domains, 
unstructured regions, tandem repeats, gene ontology.

The researcher will benefit from an exceptional environment thanks to 
the presence of numerous leading international researchers. This 
position is open for up to 4 years with a salary above the French 
post-doc standard.
